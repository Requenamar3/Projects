[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:07:26
the material that we had scheduled for last week. Jonathan?

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:07:29
I'm sorry for interrupting, but the work… because I'm, like, going crazy, like, right now, because… the word wasn't working for me and stuff like that. Does that have to be turned in today?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:07:35
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:07:39
It doesn't, don't worry about it. Let's… let's have class.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:07:42
Because I think class tonight will be helpful.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:07:45
I gave it to… I sent it out because I thought, okay, maybe if they start doing the research, you know, when we do class… because my intention, Jonathan, was to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:07:54
basically compress last week's lecture and this week's lecture and try to do it together. And I thought, okay, if they do the homework, then when we go through the material tonight, things might make a little bit more sense.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:04
But it's just… it's too much material to do in one night.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:08
Um, I don't think that's fair, so I'm gonna just, you know, kind of alter the syllabus, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:13
If you haven't turned in the homework, don't worry about it. I'll give you another extra couple of days after we finish our lecture tonight.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:19
And I think, yeah, I think when we go through the material tonight, it'll kind of help gel for everybody.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:08:19
Thank you very much.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:26
Okay,

[Sean Burke] 18:08:26
So, for… are we gonna go over the answers to the questions? Because… There's two of them that I'm curious about.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:28
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:33
Yeah, okay, we can. Um, so that's fine, we can do it collectively. So, when we get there,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:39
And you've got the questions, let me know.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:42
Okay? Alright, cool.

[Sean Burke] 18:08:42
All right. Yep.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:45
Sounds like I see a couple comments with some others with some questions, so good.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:49
You know, and listen, the work we're doing tonight, I always do the first class lecture because

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:56
I… I've been teaching for over 20 years, and in the first

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:08:59
a few years of teaching, I would go straight into Chapter 1,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:02
And then as we progressed through the semester, you know, I would find that students would get

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:08
somewhat confused between the three levels of government, like, you know, who's who at the federal level versus the state level versus the local level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:16
And I always do, if there's an election taking place during the semester, we'll do some work around those various elections, and by the time I got to that,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:24
material, you know, I found that students were super confused.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:27
So, the last several years…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:30
15 or so. Um, the first class period, I do this Intro to government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:35
that, uh, exposes you to, on a very high level,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:39
how, uh, the federal government is structured,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:42
who the individuals in the federal government are,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:45
Um, then I do the same for state government and the same for local government, and it gives you a pretty high-level understanding

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:51
of the structure, function,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:54
And the people involved in the three levels of government. So…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:09:58
We'll start class. If you've got questions, you know, we can entertain those as we go along, but I think, um, after the lecture…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:05
You know, help kind of make the assignment that you had over the weekend, um, you know, kind of come

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:10
come together a lot easier for you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:13
Alright, so with that said, I'm going to share my screen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:16
I will take attendance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:20
At the end of class…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:25
Oops, wrong screen. That's our syllabus that I was going to update and share with you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:30
I'll do that shortly.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:36
All right, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:39
Jonathan or Sean, you guys are the two boxes I see, because I've shared my screen. Can you guys see a slide that says, Welcome to American Federal Government?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:48
Beautiful. All right. No sound, so, um…

[Abiel Pedre] 18:10:48
Yes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:52
Let's go through this.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:10:59
All right. All right, so tonight we're going to spend quite a bit of time talking about American federal government. And here in the U.S., you'll learn, because we're going to spend a lot of time talking about the United States Constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:11
You will learn that everything that happens in government

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:14
From the national level to the state level to the local levels,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:18
all stems back to the United States Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:21
The Constitution is the legal document that provides the structure, function, and limitations for government at all levels.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:29
Everything that happens in government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:31
happens because the Constitution allows it to happen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:35
If it's not in the Constitution, it cannot happen, right? That's just the way the government is structured.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:40
So, um, we won't get too much into the Constitution tonight, but we will in a couple of weeks. We'll have a whole

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:47
class lecture devoted to

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:49
the Constitution, one lecture devoted to the various articles of the Constitution, of which there are seven,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:54
And then one class devoted to the 27 amendments to the Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:58
So for tonight's purposes, we're just going to be more, um, high level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:03
Alright, so let's start with our definition of government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:07
you know, what is government? And for our purposes, um, government is defined this way. And I'm going to read it, and then we're going to dissect this definition

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:15
Um, for a little bit. By the way, can you guys hear me? Okay, I had an issue with my Wi-Fi.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:20
earlier, so, okay. I think it's because it was…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:12:22
Yes.

[Armando Garcia] 18:12:23
Yeah, we can hear you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:24
It was the weather. Alright.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:25
If I sound too… I can switch to my mobile hotspot, but I think the weather where I am right now is really nice, actually.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:32
Um, so we should be okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:34
Right, so government, for our purposes, is defined as…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:37
Individuals and institutions through which policies, laws are made

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:43
enforced, and services are provided.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:47
All right, so again, individuals and institutions through which policies or laws are made, enforced, those laws are enforced, and services are provided.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:55
And here's what we mean by each one of those

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:12:58
areas within this one sentence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:01
In government, when we talk about individuals, there's basically two classes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:06
There are elected individuals, which are probably the ones that you recognize the most.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:11
And there are appointed individuals.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:16
which are basically people that work in various positions throughout government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:22
Okay? Um, elected individuals…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:26
Uh, again, are elected by the people and have a very specific role.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:31
in their elected capacity.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:34
Elected individuals are like the President of the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:38
the vice president of the United States,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:40
members of the United States Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:43
the governors of each state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:45
the members of various legislatures in each state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:50
Um, mayors of cities,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:52
county commissioners of counties, school board members,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:55
Right? So there are a lot of elected individuals.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:13:59
For the most part, other than President, Vice President, and governors,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:03
Most people that are elected

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:06
tend to be individuals who are in legislative bodies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:11
Whether it's the United States Congress, state legislatures, or municipal or county, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:18
elected positions. And those individuals are the ones that are passing laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:23
So the individuals who are elected, who are in legislative bodies,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:27
Their job is to pass laws, and we're going to talk about the three levels, and we're going to talk about the three types of legislative bodies that exist, okay?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:36
Those individuals who are in positions that are appointed, right, so if you're not elected, you're an appointed individual.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:46
are people that tend to be the ones that are either enforcing the laws,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:50
We're providing the services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:53
So those are people, for example, anybody who's a member of the military at the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:14:58
Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:01
Those people are government employees.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:03
They, um, are part of the Department of Defense,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:07
Which I think was formally changed to Department of War, but I'm not entirely clear. But anyway.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:13
What traditionally has been the Department of Defense. Um, so they are appointed individuals who work in government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:20
And their job, for the most part, if you're an appointed individual, their job is to provide services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:25
So those people in the military branch, you know, play a very important role. They're part of the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:30
Department of Defense or War, and their job is to keep us safe.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:35
Um, at the local level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:37
police officers, firefighters.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:39
Those are appointed individuals in government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:42
They get paid to do a job.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:45
And to deliver a service. Okay, so police officers in the city of Miami are not

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:51
elected people, they are appointed individuals

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:55
or appointed to do a job,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:58
You get paid for that job,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:15:59
And then they provide a service.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:01
Okay? So, when we… when we see the term individuals in government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:06
There are basically two classes, the electeds,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:08
who primarily are in positions to pass laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:13
And we see the appointed individuals.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:16
who are primarily in positions to provide a service, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:21
Because, again, the mission of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:23
Um, all governments here in the United States is basically threefold.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:27
pass laws, make sure those laws are enforced,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:30
And provide services to their constituents.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:33
And individuals in government, whether they're elected or appointed,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:37
play a role in doing one of those three things. Passing laws,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:41
Enforcing those laws and providing services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:46
All right, so we got the people part.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:49
Institutions. Institutions and government… government basically mean the structure that is in place.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:16:54
Right? How are individuals able to do their job? How are they able to pass laws, enforce those laws, and provide services?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:03
They're able to do their jobs through the structure that the United States Constitution has created.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:08
And basically, that structure is defined in the Constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:12
In the first three articles of the Constitution, which creates

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:16
the three branches of government. It creates the legislative branch,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:21
Which is the area where individuals are able to pass laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:25
It creates the judicial branch, which is the area of government whereby laws can be enforced.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:32
And it is the executive level, which is the area of government where services are able to be provided.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:39
So now we have people that are either elected or appointed,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:43
And structures…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:45
Legislative, judicial, and executive,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:47
through which people are able to accomplish three things in government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:51
Passing walls, enforcing laws, and providing services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:55
Okay. All right.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:17:57
Um, so that's what we mean when we… for our purposes, when we're talking about government, we're going to be talking in this

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:05
vein, right? So we're going to refer to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:08
The people that are authorized, whether they're elected or appointed,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:13
to do a job through the structure that's identified through the United States Constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:19
to be able to pass laws, enforce laws, and provide services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:23
Okay? All right.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:26
So, again, we're going to take a look at the three levels of government in the United States. The federal level, which is known as the national level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:34
That's our national government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:36
focuses on the entire country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:38
So, everybody in the United States of America

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:41
Right? He is governed

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:44
by the federal government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:46
Right? So the federal government passes laws for everybody in the country,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:50
Those laws are enforced for everybody in the country, and services are provided to everybody in the country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:56
That is the job of our federal government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:18:58
Right? One national government

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:01
that passes laws, enforces laws, and provides services to everybody in the United States of America.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:08
Versus state governments.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:10
We currently have 50 state governments in the United States. That number could change.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:15
The Constitution allows for additional state governments to be added.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:20
Right? So we could have a 51st date or a 52nd state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:24
Right? Puerto Rico, Guam, uh, Virgin Islands,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:27
any of our territories at some point could become a state in the future.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:32
And those states are all governed by a state constitution that derives from the United States Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:39
So, state constitutions are modeled after the Constitution of the United States, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:44
And not surprisingly, they too have 3 branches of government that allow the individuals in state governments, whether they're elected individuals or appointed individuals,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:54
to do their job, which is one of three things.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:19:57
Pass laws, enforce those laws, or provide services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:01
Okay? And then finally, local governments.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:05
Local governments here in the United States, there are over 100,000 all throughout the U.S.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:10
Because local governments are very buried, right? You've got municipalities, like cities, towns, villages,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:16
You have counties, you have school boards,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:19
Um, yeah, basically those, those type of governments that focus on a very specific geographic

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:25
area that does three things, right? There are people in local governments that…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:30
Pass laws, enforce those laws, and provide services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:34
All right, so now we kind of see…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:36
The three levels of government, and we'll…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:40
soon find out that the three levels have the exact same structure,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:44
The difference between the three, of course, is that the federal government focuses on the entire country,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:49
So that people that are part of the federal government, those elected people like the President of the United States,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:55
or the vice president, or the members of the United States Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:20:58
Uh, and then the appointed people at the federal level,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:01
Their focus is on passing laws, enforcing laws, and providing services to everybody

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:06
in the entire country of the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:10
Um, versus the state governments.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:12
Whereby the people that are involved in state government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:16
whether they are, um, appointed or elected,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:20
Their job is to pass laws, enforce those laws, and provide services for the residents of that particular state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:27
For example, Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:29
And then the local governments. A lot of them throughout the United States, a lot of cities, a lot of counties, a lot of school boards,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:35
Their job, those people that are elected or appointed to those local governments, their job is to pass laws, enforce laws, and provide services to the residents.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:45
and the constituents of that particular local government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:48
All right, so let's take a look at each of these three levels more in depth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:53
I will start, of course, with the federal government, the structure of the federal government is defined.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:21:58
in great detail by the United States Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:02
Um, Constitution was ratified in 1787.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:06
Right? So we're approaching the 240th anniversary of the Constitution of the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:13
Um, at this point, our U.S. Constitution is the oldest Constitution in the world, meaning…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:21
that even though we're not the oldest country, because we weren't established until 1776, so we're a relatively young country, right? We'll celebrate our 250th anniversary next year.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:32
But the Constitution that we've had in place in this country since 1787 is the one that has been around the longest at this point.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:41
So there are a lot of countries that are, um, you know, much more historic than we are.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:46
Great Britain, from which we came, France, Spain, China,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:50
you know, there are lots of countries that have been around a lot longer than the United States, however,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:56
at some point after we ratified our Constitution in 1787,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:01
these other countries also ratified their constitutions, right? So at this point in history,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:06
Our Constitution's the one that's been around the longest.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:10
I always like to tell my students, and we'll talk a little bit more about this when we get to the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:14
material on the Constitution itself.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:16
But I always like to say, you know, the best compliment, I think, was ever paid to the United States was when Great Britain…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:23
The country that we came from, that we declared ourselves independent from and created our own country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:28
About a hundred… less than 100 years after…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:32
Uh, we declared ourselves independent and ratified our Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:35
that Great Britain itself, then, uh, amended their constitution

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:41
And, um, modeled their current constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:45
After our Constitution, right? So here we were, you know, in the mid-1700s, declaring ourselves independent from Great Britain, because we didn't like the way they were governing,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:54
you know, people, um, to less than 100 years later, Great Britain

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:58
changing the way they govern their people and modeling it after the United States. What a… I mean, man, what can get better than that? What better compliment can be paid to a country than that?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:09
Alright, so our U.S. Constitution created the structure, the function, and the limitations of our national government in the United States, as well as the basis for state and local governments as well.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:20
So, when we go through the structure of the federal government, the state governments, and the local governments,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:25
The structure is identical. All three levels of government

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:28
have the same structure. They all have a legislative branch,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:31
They all have a judicial branch, and they all have an executive branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:35
The difference is…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:37
Right? Who the people are,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:40
Is they're different at the federal level, the state level, and the local level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:43
And who the beneficiaries are.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:46
Because the work the federal government does benefits the entire country, right? Everybody in every single state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:52
Versus the work done by state governments only benefits those people residing in that particular state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:59
Versus the work done by local governments,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:02
only benefit the people residing within that particular local jurisdiction.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:07
So, um, as I mentioned earlier, the first three articles of the Constitution creates three branches of government, legislative, executive, and judicial.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:15
The focus of the legislative branch is to pass laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:19
The focus of the executive branch is to provide services,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:22
And the focus of the judicial branch is to interpret laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:26
Again, all three levels of government, federal, state, and local, have a legislative branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:31
They have an executive branch, and they have a judicial branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:34
So even though the structure is identical on purpose, the Constitution requires it to be that way,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:41
the people at each level are different.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:44
And who benefits at each level is different as well. And that's basically going to be the bulk of our work tonight.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:49
is talking about, um, who those people are,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:52
Both that are providing the service,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:55
and receiving the service at each of these three levels of government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:00
Alright, so let's start with the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:03
Right? So the Constitution of the United States, this is a little visual here for you, the Constitution of the United States creates a, um, you know, three branches of government for the federal government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:13
And, um, I think at the U.S. level, at the national or federal level,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:18
The legislative branch, whose job it is to make laws,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:22
is called the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:25
Right? United States Congress is made up of two chambers, the United States Senate,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:31
in the United States House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:35
The executive branch, whose job it is to carry out the laws and to provide services,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:41
is headed up by the President of the United States,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:43
The Vice President of the United States,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:45
And by various cabinet-level departments and agencies that basically provide those services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:51
Alright? And then the judicial branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:54
Um, which basically interprets the laws, if you're accused of violating the law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:00
Their job is to, um, you know, basically

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:04
conducted by the United States Supreme Court, and then by other courts that are in place.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:10
Okay. All right, so let's take a look.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:14
Um, at the federal level, right, we've got the legislative branch that is comprised of the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:21
whose job it is to pass laws for everybody in the entire country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:26
The executive branch at the federal level is made up of the United States President, the Vice President, and then various federal

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:33
departments and agencies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:35
And then the judicial branch, which is made up by the United States U.S. courts. Their job is to interpret laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:42
Alright, so let's start with the legislative branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:45
The United States Congress

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:47
Right? The federal legislative branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:51
is a bicameral legislature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:53
Meaning that it's made up of two parts. So there's one United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:59
But that U.S. Congress is made up of two parts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:01
One is the United States Senate, of which there are 100 members.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:06
The other is the United States House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:09
Of which there are 435 members.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:12
Together, the job of Congress is to pass laws for the entire country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:17
Meaning that everybody in the country is impacted by the laws that are passed by the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:23
So even though Congress is, you know, made up of two different chambers, the Senate and the House,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:29
They don't pass laws individually, the Senate and the House. They have to work individually as a unit. The Senate does their work, the House does their work.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:37
And then, at some point, the House and the Senate come together,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:41
And they passed one law, um, from the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:45
So the Senate and the House aren't able to pass laws individually. They have to do it collectively, together,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:51
as one body, as the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:55
All right, so let's look at these a little closer.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:58
The U.S. Senate, um, 100 senators,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:01
Two per state. I mentioned earlier that the Constitution has a provision that allows for adding additional states, right? So we… Puerto Rico could become the 51st state,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:10
Guam can become the 52nd U.S. Virgin Islands could become the 53rd.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:15
So, whenever a state is added,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:18
then that state will be allotted two U.S. Senators to represent them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:23
Okay? All states have the same number of U.S. senators.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:26
So, regardless of size, every state has equal representation in the U.S. Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:31
Florida has two that represents Florida, California has two that represent California.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:35
Texas has 2, Michigan has two, New York has two, Alaska has 2, North Dakota has two, Hawaii has two.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:42
Every state has the same number of senators.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:45
equal representation in the U.S. Senate. So no state, regardless of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:49
geographic size and or population has an upper hand in the Senate. Every state has equal number of votes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:57
The Senate is considered the upper chamber in Congress, because it's the smaller chamber, right? So the senators have more of an opportunity to be involved.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:05
in more of the work that they do, because it's a smaller body.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:08
Right, it's about less than a fourth the size of the U.S. House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:14
Their job is to pass laws, however, the Senate alone cannot pass laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:19
without doing it collectively and jointly with the House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:23
You're going to see as we go on in this course that, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:28
Our founding fathers, you know, when we declared ourselves independent from Great Britain, and in putting the Constitution together,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:36
They really thought through

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:38
how they had been governed, um, you know, when they were subjects of Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:43
And much of what is in the Constitution is almost the opposite of how they were governed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:48
So you will find that practically every structure in government

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:53
has what's called a checks and balance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:57
And the checks and balance is a concept whereby, at least in the United States, in our government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:02
No one individual or a small group of people, or even one body of people,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:07
has all the power. Everything that happens has a checks and balance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:11
right, has somebody that has to, in concurrence with them,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:15
do something in order for that action to be effective.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:19
And that was in direct correlation. It was the opposite of how they were governed under the monarch, under the kings and queens, right? Where the king or queen was

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:27
What they said went. They were designated by God, right? So nobody had a right to question them. So it was their way

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:32
Or no way. So in putting together how we were going to be governed,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:36
It was not going to be that way at all. They wanted to make sure that under no circumstances, one person or a group of people

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:42
ever had the power by themselves, that everything always had to have the checks and balance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:47
So this is probably, you know, one of the earlier examples we'll see in our government, is that Congress is a checks and balance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:54
You have the Senate and the House, and they have to work together in order for them to be able to do their job.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:59
If they don't come together and agree collectively, then…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:02
their work doesn't happen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:04
Right? You'll also come to see that, um, the three branches of government

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:09
our checks and balances to themselves. So at the federal level,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:13
Um, you know, for example, Congress, if they pass a law, if the Senate and the House agree on something, and it passes out Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:20
Well, that doesn't mean that the law goes into effect.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:24
Because the checks and balance to the legislative branch, to the Congress, is the president.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:29
So in our government, the president has to approve

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:33
that, um, that law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:34
Right? So, the president acts as a checks and balance to the work that Congress does.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:41
And you'll see that in every action in government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:44
There's always an accountability, there's always a checks and balance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:47
The President of the United States. You know, a lot of people, President Trump is a very active, you know, kind of go-getter kind of president.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:54
When he first got elected in 2016, you know, on the platform that he was going to run government more like a business, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:59
You know, he had been a very successful business person,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:02
Um, he found a lot of challenges in his first administration.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:06
Because he was trying to do things by himself, you know, in his private

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:10
businesses, he was the CEO.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:12
He was a king. He… whatever he said went, right? Because it was his business.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:16
And he could do that. And he came in wanting to do that, you know, wanting to, like, move really fast and do things really quickly.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:23
Well, he was shut down very early on in his administration.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:28
Because he was initiating certain things,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:31
that weren't permissible in the Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:33
Because the role of the president, you know, is very limited in the Constitution and requires certain checks and balances, and he was bypassing those.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:40
So the Supreme Court that acts as the checks and balance to the work that the President does would say, hey, you can't do that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:46
And Trump would be like, why not? You know, this is for the good of the people. And the Supreme Court would say,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:51
It may very well be for the good of the people, but in order for you to do that, you have to follow a process, and it has to go to certain approvals.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:58
Right? So that was hard for Trump, because in the business world, you can just do things

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:03
without these checks and balances.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:05
And, you know, a lot of people find that it's what we call bureaucracy, right? It's what we call government moves so slow, you know, it's hard to get anything done in government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:14
But guess what? Our Founding Fathers designed that on purpose. They wanted our government to be bureaucratic.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:21
They wanted it to move slowly, because…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:24
It was the alternative to how they had been governed under a king, where things would just happen from one moment to the next.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:29
Right? And they didn't think that was fair.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:31
or really reflective of what the people needed or wanted.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:35
So they specifically created a structure that is bureaucratic.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:39
That requires checks and balances, right? And that is bureaucratic. It's gonna take time. It's not gonna happen overnight.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:46
So, um, I know it's frustrating, but it was designed that way on purpose, you know, and it's worked!

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:52
For 240 years, almost, and not only that, it's worked so well that most governments around the world that are democratic

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:01
I've also, you know, put in place these checks and balances to ensure that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:04
you know, the right things are happening. You know, it slows it down,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:09
But it ensures fairness.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:11
Okay, let's take a look for a minute.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:18
at the United States Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:20
And I'm going to do this very quickly, because in a couple weeks, when we cover the chapter on Congress, um, you know, we'll obviously take a really close look.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:29
at the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. But I just kind of wanted to give you

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:33
a link. I put this link in here because I would have done

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:37
this presentation, you know, and then giving you the homework assignment that I gave you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:41
Right? Um, and this link, obviously, would have helped in that assignment, because you'd be able to find the answer to the question about who our two senators are, but…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:50
Um, let me cover the house first, and then I'll open it up to any questions anybody may have had.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:55
or may have, about, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:58
the overview and or about, you know, trying to find some of the answers to your questions.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:04
Okay, so let me move to the house.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:09
House of Representatives at the United States level, um, there are 435 members.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:14
This is structured differently than the Senate. This is based on population, so every state…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:20
may have a different number of representatives

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:23
then, um, you know, in the Senate, it's 2 per state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:27
in the house, it is… depends on population.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:30
The states with larger populations, like

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:33
California, Texas, Florida, New York.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:36
have more representatives than states with smaller populations. Alaska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, right? Those states have a very small population.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:44
So they have a less number.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:46
Every state is guaranteed at least one member

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:50
in the House of Representatives. So those states that I just mentioned with small populations, Alaska, the Dakotas, you know, Rhode Island,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:56
They have one, right? Um, versus states like California, Texas, Florida, that have many more.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:03
Florida has 29, Texas has, I believe, 32, California, I believe, has 53. That's how much bigger they are than…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:10
every other state, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:13
Um, so this was designed on purpose as well, right? So…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:18
Yeah.

[Sean Burke] 18:37:18
Is… is that what affects the Electoral College? Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:20
Yeah, that's exactly what affects you in with Torah College.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:23
When we get to Article 2 of the Constitution, where the Electoral College is defined,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:28
The Electoral College is defined by the number of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:32
Senators and representatives in the country, right? So…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:36
Sean, you just asked a question, so if we have 100 senators,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:39
And 435 members,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:41
And how many total Electoral college votes do we have?

[Sean Burke] 18:37:47
535?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:48
Yes, accepts that the Constitution was amended to allow the District of Columbia to also have

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:54
three electoral votes, so we actually have 538 electoral votes. But the Electoral College is defined by the number of senators and representatives.

[Sean Burke] 18:37:59
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:04
combined plus the 3 that the District of Columbia gets. So that's… that's the other four of college.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:08
Yeah, when we go through Article 2, there's a whole provision in that section of Article 2 that talks about the creation of the Electoral College.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:15
And it's all based on this.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:17
And one of your writing assignments, you know, you got 3 of them that you'll have to do this semester.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:23
One of your writing assignments is to do research on the Electoral College.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:26
It's a super, super important process.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:28
Not a lot of people understand it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:31
Um, you know, some people even… sometimes they question it as to whether or not it's the right way to elect a president versus by popular vote.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:38
But I'm gonna let you guys do your own research on that, and then you make your own determination as to what you think.

[Sean Burke] 18:38:41
One of those people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:45
Sean, I know, you know, it's kind of counterintuitive that a democracy,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:49
Um, the president isn't elected by necessarily a popular vote, although

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:55
99 times, you know, 97% of the time, the Electoral College vote does match the popular vote, although in the last couple elections, that hasn't seemed to be the case.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:03
Which is creating the debate, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:05
But, for the most part, you know, the process had been around for 240 years, and it's worked.

[Sean Burke] 18:39:06
Yes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:10
I won't get too much into it tonight, because we're going to talk about it in a couple weeks plus.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:14
you're going to do a whole research project that'll be, uh, you know, graded, um, to really give you the ability to

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:20
do some research yourself and really kind of understand the process, so that by the time the next election comes,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:26
In 2028,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:28
And hopefully all of you vote,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:30
Uh, you'll really understand the process and be able to, you know, kind of go vote and then understand what

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:35
what the impacts of that vote are.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:38
All right, so let me keep going with the house. Um, like I said, with the Senate,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:42
You know, the job of the House of Representatives is to pass laws, but it has to be done in conjunction

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:48
with the United States Senate, all right? So you got one Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:52
two bodies within the one Congress, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:56
They both basically do their work very similar,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:59
However, the people in the Senate are obviously different than the people in the House.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:03
Right, you have 100 senators in the Senate, you have 435 members. So if you're a United States Senator, you're not in the House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:10
If you're in the U.S. House of Representatives, you're not in the Senate,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:14
What gets confusing to people is,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:16
Both the Senators and the representatives are in the Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:19
Right? But of course, now you know that the Congress is divided into two parts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:24
Um, so you're either in the U.S. Senate or in the U.S. House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:28
Here's the site for the house.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:30
in a couple of weeks when we cover the chapter on the Congress, we'll, you know, probe more fully into all of these various areas of the House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:39
Both the site for the Senate and the House, I think, do a nice job, so we'll use these as resources

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:44
Um, for our work when we get to that chapter.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:46
Okay? Alright, let me stop here and open it up to any questions, including…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:53
Any questions on your homework assignment? Because I suspect maybe some of the people that you…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:57
had trouble finding may have been either in the U.S. Senate or in the U.S. House of Representatives. So, Jonathan, I'll start with you, because I think you raised the issue first.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:41:09
My issue, mister… I'm sorry. But my issue was mostly, like, on the actual Word document.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:41:11
Yeah.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:41:15
I don't know why every time I'm trying to log in.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:41:18
Like, I'm logging in with my school email. This gives you a Word account.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:41:21
Yeah.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:41:24
A free one. I'm trying to log in with it, but every time I open your file specifically, it keeps on telling me that I have to pay to edit it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:41:33
Huh? No, because I sent it as a Word document that's editable, so, uh, anybody else have that issue?

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:41:33
Yeah. I don't know… I don't know why, but it keeps on telling me that… that I have to pay monthly to edit.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:41:42
The file.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:41:43
No, I've never ever heard of that. Anybody else having that issue?

[Angel Lamas] 18:41:46
Me, personally, I use…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:41:47
Could be that you don't have any space and a hard drive in the cloud for the Miami-Day.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:41:54
Because, uh, in my case, it doesn't let me save any document in Excel or anything.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:42:00
And, uh, in the cloud.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:03
Yeah, and let me ask you a question, Jonathan. Did you try to access it through the email?

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:42:07
I've also tried, like, accessing it through the email. The most because I have two different things, so I have my actual PC.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:42:14
And I have my Mac, um… my MacBook Pro?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:19
Yeah.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:42:20
But… but I tried logging into my Mac, and that let me… let me see it through my Mac, but every time I try to plug it into my PC, it just doesn't want to open at all. So, at least through my Mac, I'm able to see the assignment.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:26
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:30
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:35
Yeah.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:42:35
Um, but… Besides that, I can't, like, edit it or anything for some reason. I can pull it up so you can see it right now.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:42
Yeah. No, that's okay, let's do it after class, Jonathan, or maybe if you give me a personal email, I can try to send it that way and see if maybe if you're outside the NBC system…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:50
It allows you to. So, um, alright.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:53
Okay, did you have any spec… oh, I guess you didn't… weren't able to see the questions. Okay, so anybody…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:58
have specific questions about

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:01
the people, trying to find the people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:04
In Congress, let's focus first on Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:07
Everybody found the two U.S. Senators?

[Angel Lamas] 18:43:09
It was. It was this one question that confused me. It was the one question where they were going to…

[Jessica Mursuli] 18:43:10
Oh, no, it was… the justices.

[Angel Lamas] 18:43:16
I forgot the sentence, or the question in general, but it really confused me.

[Angel Lamas] 18:43:22
It was the ones that were, like, already in the position.

[Angel Lamas] 18:43:26
Or were about to be in that position, like. I didn't… I couldn't figure that question out.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:27
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:31
But Angel, are you talking about… are you talking about the members of Congress, like either the U.S. Senators, like…

[Abiel Pedre] 18:43:31
Actually… Actually…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:36
Let me ask you a question, Joe. Did you find the two U.S. senators that represented the report?

[Abiel Pedre] 18:43:39
Actually, I have a whisker and microubial. I was caught in Marco Rubio.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:44
I'm sorry, repeat that?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:49
Okay.

[Sean Burke] 18:43:50
Oh, Rick Scott, or Michael Rubio? I have Ashley Moody and Rick Scott for the two U.S. Senators.

[Abiel Pedre] 18:43:53
Mm-hmm.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:56
Yes. Correct, Sean, and you're right. Ashley Moody replaced Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio had been in the U.S. Senate for many years. However,

[Sean Burke] 18:43:58
And I have…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:06
After the most recent election, President Trump selected

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:10
Senator Rubio to serve as Secretary of State.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:13
So currently, Marco Rubio is our Secretary of State. He works for the President of the United States in the Executive Branch,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:19
So therefore, he resigned his Senate seat,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:22
And Ashley Moody now is the U.S. Senator representing Florida. So the correct answer for the two U.S. Senators that represent Florida

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:29
Our Rick Scott, he is the Senior U.S. Senator.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:31
Uh, he's been there longer than Ashley Moody, and Ashley Moody, who was just really appointed,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:36
you know, really at the start of this year, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:41
when Marco Rubio resigned to go work for President Trump.

[Sean Burke] 18:44:44
Don't go to college, Sarah. Those are the two I wanted to talk about, too.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:45
Yeah, Jessica, you've got your hand up.

[Jessica Mursuli] 18:44:47
Yeah, I couldn't find, and I looked, and I looked. On Google and everything, um, the justices that were retiring in this month.

[Jessica Mursuli] 18:44:57
And who was nominated preceding? Whoever resigned.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:00
Yeah. Okay, hold that question. I'm gonna wait… I'm gonna just get through Congress first, and then we'll…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:09
Yeah. You know…

[Sean Burke] 18:45:11
I answered them, but… questionable.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:13
Yeah, okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:15
Okay, I may have…

[Sean Burke] 18:45:16
You hear me, sir?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:17
Yeah, I may have recycled this homework assignment from a previous class I taught when there was a retirement coming on, so let's look at…

[Jessica Mursuli] 18:45:23
I had a feeling, I left it blank for that reason.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:26
Okay, that's cool. I think probably I drafted this, and I didn't review it before I sent it to you guys.

[Sean Burke] 18:45:29
But I'm dropping off.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:30
But I probably did this last semester when there was a retirement, um, so… alright, disregard that question, because no, nobody is retiring.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:38
That, uh, that we know of at this point.

[Sean Burke] 18:45:40
Someone is actually… Someone is retiring.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:42
What's that?

[Sean Burke] 18:45:45
But they're not a Supreme Court Justice, they're a… Okay, she is, but at the state level. Mary Yu.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:45:53
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

[Sean Burke] 18:45:54
She's the Washington State Supreme Court Justice. And she's not exactly retiring in September, she just announced.

[Sean Burke] 18:46:02
Her retirement in September. She won't retire until… Uh, December.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:05
Yeah, no, no worries. I met at the United States Supreme Court, so…

[Jessica Mursuli] 18:46:08
You meant federal level, yeah, not state. I saw Mary, you too, yeah.

[Sean Burke] 18:46:08
Okay. Got it. That's what I thought, but…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:12
No question, Jessica, is that one? What number?

[Jessica Mursuli] 18:46:15
I don't know what number…

[Sean Burke] 18:46:16
Uh, they're not numbered, but it's under… judicial branch federal.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:17
Oh, okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:20
Okay, alright, so yeah, when you get to that question about the retiring Supreme Court justices at the U.S. Supreme Court, disregard that question. Um, I need to update it.

[Sean Burke] 18:46:21
Um, yeah.

[Jessica Mursuli] 18:46:28
It's two of them.

[Abiel Pedre] 18:46:29
That's another one, the Miami-Dade County Public School Board members, so I cannot find anybody for them either.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:30
Just two of them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:34
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:36
Okay. All right, well, hold that…

[Abiel Pedre] 18:46:38
Got a new link.

[Alejandro Lorenzo] 18:46:38
What are you on the screen?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:40
Did anybody have a problem finding their representative in the United States House of Representatives?

[Sean Burke] 18:46:44
No.

[Alejandro Lorenzo] 18:46:44
No.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:45
Okay, cool, because I was going to say, if you did, you go to this site, you went through your zip code, your address, and then it tells you who your representative is. So, okay, cool.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:53
All right, okay. So…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:55
let's wait on anything other than a senator and or a representative at the federal level, and then…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:02
If you've got questions about those people, when we get to that area,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:05
then we'll, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:07
we'll take a look at it. Alright, so let me go back to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:13
PowerPoint.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:18
All right, so that's…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:20
United States Congress, for now, we're not done with it, but…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:23
Let's just do a recap, right? So we know that the United States Congress is the legislative body which passes laws at the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:32
Um, laws passed by the United States Congress apply to everyone living or visiting the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:37
And we know that U.S. Congress is a bicameral legislative body,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:41
Consisting of the United States Senate, of which there are 100 U.S. Senators,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:46
in the United States House of Representatives, of which there are 435 U.S. Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:51
Alright, so that's our recap of that. We're not done with it, but let's just move on now.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:56
To the executive branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:57
at the federal level. So, at the federal level,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:01
The executive branch, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:03
whose job, you know, the role of the executive branch is to deliver services to the American people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:10
The executive branch is headed up by the President of the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:13
probably the individual government that most people are…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:18
familiar with or aware of, right? That tends to be the person that we can identify

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:25
Um, the easiest

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:26
Uh, in government, right? People tend to know who the President of the United States is.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:31
From there on down, it gets a little murky, right? You know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:34
I'm sure 2 weeks ago, I could ask you the question, who's the current president of the United States? And I'm sure all of you knew who the answer was.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:41
But if I would have asked you who your two U.S. Senators are representing Florida, or you're a representative in the United States House of Representatives, you may or may not have known.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:50
Right? Um, I could even ask you who maybe the current U.S. Vice President is.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:55
And I would suspect most of you would know, but I would suspect that maybe some of you didn't know until you did this assignment.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:00
But anyway, at the executive branch at the federal level,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:04
The President of the United States, uh, in that role, the President is really…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:10
Really, the chief executive officer of the federal government. You know, if you look at the federal government as a business,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:15
Um, the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:18
the role of the CEO is really the president.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:21
Right? And most businesses, the way they're structured is, you know, you have a CEO,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:26
that reports to a board of directors or works in tandem with the board of directors, and that's kind of like the role of the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:33
Right, and all businesses have a legal arm, an attorney that works very closely with the CEO and the board of directors to do the work collectively.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:41
In that role on the legal side, you know, in the case of the federal government, is the judicial branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:47
Right? So the executive branch really…

[Sean Burke] 18:49:48
Hey. Hey. Oh, she left for Arden.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:50
functions as, you know, the area of government that basically delivers services. You've got a CEO that heads up the entire executive branch,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:59
The president is assisted by the Vice President of the United States.

[Sean Burke] 18:50:02
Didn't you have a, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:05
Sean, you asking a question?

[Sean Burke] 18:50:08
Sorry about that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:08
Okay. All right, so you got the Vice President of the United States, right? The Vice President of the United States is in place for a couple of specific reasons.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:17
One of which is, of course, to assist the President on a day-to-day basis, but…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:21
Also, in the event if something happens to the president,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:25
the Vice President per the Constitution is the individual

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:29
that would assume the responsibilities of the president.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:32
And then you've got, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:35
Currently, 15 very large departments at the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:40
and 100-plus agencies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:42
at the federal level, uh, whose job it is to basically… that's how services are delivered to the American people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:50
Right? To the American people, um, their work is done.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:55
Um, uh, the work that services they receive happens through either one of the

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:00
departments and or agencies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:02
Okay? We'll not get too much into the departments and agencies tonight, as we'll, you know, obviously when we get to the chapter on the President and the executive branch, have a chance to really focus on those.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:14
But the departments, for example, are ones that you've heard of or are familiar with, you know, on a very large scale, it's things like the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:24
Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:28
of the interior of education, veterans affairs, right? There's 15 very, very large departments.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:34
who have a very broad mission, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:37
as part of the delivery of services to the American people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:40
And then, in addition to those departments,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:43
There are a number of agencies that exist, over 100 of them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:47
Things like FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:51
or the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:54
Um, or…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:57
Uh, the U.S. Postal Service.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:59
You know, there are areas of government that have a very specific, focused mission,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:04
They're not part of a larger department, um, and that's really the difference between the departments and the agencies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:10
Departments have a very broad mission that's accomplished, you know, in many different ways, like,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:15
Department of Defense, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:17
They do their work in a number of different ways.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:19
Right? And they have the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, the Marines, all of those branches of the military to help them achieve their goal.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:25
of keeping the United States safe.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:28
So it's a very broad mission that's accomplished in a lot of different ways.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:32
Versus agencies whose missions are much more focused.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:36
FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, their mission is to

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:42
Help communities prepare and respond to national emergencies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:47
Whether it's a hurricane, a tornado, a flood, an earthquake,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:51
Whatever that emergency may be, FEMA is there to help before,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:55
and after. The U.S. Postal Service.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:58
Right? Their job is to deliver mail from point A to point B.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:02
They do it the same way in Florida, like they do in Hawaii, or Alaska, or Maine.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:07
Right? The weather conditions may be different, so how the postal carriers dress in Miami…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:12
may be different than how they dress in Alaska in January, if they even deliver mail in January in Alaska, right? Who knows?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:19
Right? But their job is the same. The mission of the Postal Service is to deliver mail from point A to point B.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:25
Okay? So the missions of agencies are much more focused.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:30
The missions and departments are much broader in nature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:33
Again, we'll have a chance to really look at, um, all of the departments and all of the agencies on a very broad scale.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:40
in a couple of weeks when we get to the chapter on the presidency.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:43
Okay? There's a link, you guys can access it if you need it, um, for, you know, the various questions that I ask in your assignment, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:51
We can visit it…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:54
When we get to this chapter in a couple of weeks, we'll obviously use… what the heck?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:00
Okay, so, uh, we couldn't find that page back to home.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:05
Okay, there we go. Okay, um, you know, when we cover the chapter on the president and the executive branch, we'll use this site as a, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:15
As a resource, right? And as a, uh, a set of information

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:21
Because it's much more current than any other data point that we have.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:27
All right. Again, job of the executive branch to deliver services to all the American people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:32
wherever they live. Miami, Maui,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:35
Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, wherever they live,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:38
The job of the executive branch is to put other people, alright, services to all of the American people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:45
Alright, and now the third branch at the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:48
at the national level, right? It's made up of the United States court system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:53
The job of the judicial branch is to interpret laws in the U.S. If there's a violation of a federal law,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:01
Sean, I'll ask you, because you're the box I see. Who is responsible for passing federal laws?

[Abiel Pedre] 18:55:08
Congress?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:09
Congress, thank you.

[Sean Burke] 18:55:10
I'm just so focused on being a boss of Boston Foss that she don't care about nobody.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:13
Yeah, Congress.

[Sean Burke] 18:55:15
Like, she had a whole meeting. She had a whole meeting, it was all about her, like, that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:17
You know, I mean, meeting everybody.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:21
Guys, somebody's unmuted, so I'm gonna try to find…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:24
There you go, got it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:26
Um, yeah, so Congress passes federal laws. So if anybody violates a federal law,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:30
You know, and you're held accountable for it, you're going to go to a federal court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:35
All right, so federal laws are things like

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:38
counterfeiting, for example.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:41
So, if you're accused of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:43
creating money, right? You're not allowed to do that, because the Constitution says that only…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:50
The United States Congress has the ex…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:53
the exclusive responsibility to authorize the pointing and printing of money.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:58
So if anybody other than the Congress…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:00
for the U.S. Mint does that,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:03
They are breaking a federal law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:05
And if you break that federal law, you know, so if your friend John, you know, is in a garage in…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:11
Miami printing money, right, and he gets busted.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:15
He's going to be accused of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:17
you know, counterfeiting. And he's going to go to a federal court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:21
And a federal court will look at the circumstances of the case and determine what the outcome will be.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:26
At the federal court system,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:29
There are basically three levels that exist.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:31
Alright, I'm going to start at the bottom level, which is the district

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:34
The district courts are the ones that you probably are most familiar with.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:39
Because the structure of the district courts includes a judge,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:43
a jury, a defense, headed up by an attorney that's defending the individual that's been accused of the crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:49
And then the prosecution, which is basically the federal government, the Department of Justice,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:54
Whose job it is to prove that the individual was being accused of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:58
violating this law is guilty.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:01
Right? So that's what we see in the movies and on TV, you know, a judge, a jury, a defense, and a prosecution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:07
Um, and that's basically where, you know, 95% of all cases…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:12
at the federal level originate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:15
If you're in violation of a law, the likelihood is that you're going to go to a district court

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:20
At the district court, one of two things, basically, will happen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:23
Right? The prosecution will present their case as to why they think the government

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:30
believes that the individual is guilty of the crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:33
The defense will present their case as to why they think that the individual that's accused is…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:38
not guilty of the crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:41
The facts will be presented to a jury of peers of the individual that's being charged with the crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:47
The jury will deliberate and determine whether or not

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:53
Um, they believe, you know, the individual is guilty, and they will render a verdict.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:59
to the judge. And once that verdict is rendered, then the judge will issue the appropriate sentencing.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:04
Right, so that's what we see in the movies, that's what we see in TV, we're familiar with that structure.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:09
Right. If you are found not guilty,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:13
by the jury, and there's no sentencing by the judge, then you are free to go.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:17
And you, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:19
you know, can never be accused of that specific crime, uh, ever again, because the Constitution and the Fifth Amendment prohibits it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:27
If you're found guilty, however,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:30
You have an automatic right to appeal it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:33
to an appellate court at the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:36
The appellate court is structured differently than the district court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:40
District Court, remember, is a judge, a jury, a defense, and a prosecution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:44
An appellate court is a panel of three judges.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:47
That will review the circumstances of the case,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:50
And what was presented at trial?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:52
and determine if any error was made.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:55
And the appellate court has the ability

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:59
to overturn

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:01
the guilty verdict of the District Court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:03
Right, so the appellate court, when they looked at the circumstances, they'll, uh…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:08
get to one of two points.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:10
They'll either uphold the guilty verdict of the District Court,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:14
Or they will overturn it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:16
If they overturn it, it means the individual is as if they were never convicted of the crime, and then they are free to go.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:22
Right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:25
If the individual at the appellate level is found guilty, then they too can appeal it to the Supreme Court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:30
And the Supreme Court is the Supreme.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:33
court in the land, everything stops at the Supreme Court, the buck stops there, whatever the Supreme Court decides.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:39
That is it, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:41
Um, so, uh, you know, they are the arbitrator of the final word of any legal interpretation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:49
The reason there's 3 court systems

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:51
you know, within the United States courts is going back to that concept of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:56
um, checks and balances.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:58
Our Founding Fathers wanted to make sure that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:01
in our court system, there were enough checks and balances that even if an individual was found guilty,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:07
There was the ability for another set of eyes to look at the circumstances,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:12
And either agree or disagree. And that there was even another set of eyes outside of the appellate court that perhaps could do that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:18
And guess what? Because every branch of government has to have a checks and balance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:24
Anybody know what the checks and balance to the judicial branch is?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:27
Who outside the judicial branch has the ability

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:30
to overturn a decision that the federal courts have made.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:00:35
The president…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:37
Yeah, how… well, how does the president do that?

[Alejandro Lorenzo] 19:00:39
The Supreme Court.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:00:41
Vero.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:42
Your departments, right? So the Constitution of the United States

[Sean Burke] 19:00:44
This caused socio

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:46
allows the president, it's one of the rights of the president,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:49
that they can pardon any individual that's been convicted by

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:54
the federal courts, right? And a lot of people don't like that. They think it's like, wait a minute.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:58
There's got to be something fishy about that. And, you know, sometimes there is, unfortunately.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:03
But the reason that the President has this ability to issue pardons is because…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:09
That is what our founding fathers determined to be the checks and balance to the court system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:13
Because even though within the court system,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:15
There are 3, you know, levels, or 3 bite at the apples.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:19
Our founding fathers wanted to make sure that there's always a checks and balance to every branch of government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:25
So Congress has it with the President, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:28
requiring the President to sign off on any law that's passed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:32
Um, the president has it with the Supreme Court, with the Supreme Court kind of, you know, watching to see what they can or cannot do according to the Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:40
The judicial branch has it with the president, you know, the president has the ability to pardon anybody, even if all three levels have found that individual guilty.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:48
Right? So there's all of these elements of checks and balances that exist within the branches themselves, right? So in Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:55
You have Congress, it's divided into two parts, the Senate and the House act as a checks and balance to each other.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:01
In the judicial branch, um, you know, you have the checks and balances between the district,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:06
appellate and Supreme Courts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:08
And then outside of the judicial branch, you have the president that plays a role.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:13
Alright, so you have all of these elements of checks and balances that exist,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:17
You know, not only within the branches themselves,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:20
But amongst the branches as well. A lot of checks and balances. Again,

[Sean Burke] 19:02:25
Is…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:25
That's why things tend to be bureaucratic in government, but it was designed that way on purpose. It was designed not to be easy, not to be fast.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:33
Not to be efficient, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:35
And even though those sound like opposites of how we want to run things,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:39
It was designed that way on purpose to ensure that you always had different sets of eyes, different perspectives,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:46
taking things into account. Somebody had a question?

[Sean Burke] 19:02:51
Yeah, I did. Is that really a check and balance? Like, when you… when a president pardons someone.

[Sean Burke] 19:03:00
After 3 different courts have found him guilty. It's really just an override.

[Sean Burke] 19:03:05
I mean…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:06
Yeah. Yes?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:07
Yeah, that's why the presidential pardon, I'll be honest with you, you know, for me,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:13
Very often, the pardons that are issued by the president, you know, you can always draw a line, like,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:19
Clinton was famous for this, right? President Clinton, when he… like, presidents, by the way,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:25
tend to not pardon

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:27
in their first term, unless they don't get re-elected, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:30
Uh, if they get re-elected, they tend to really not pardon until the end of their second term. Clinton was famous for this, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:37
basically anybody in this first term,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:39
Because you got re-elected, but in his second term, like, two days before he left office, he pardoned, like, 400 people. You know, it was, like, a lot of people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:46
Well, you know, of course, the media drew the lines of who those people were and what connection they had to the Clintons, somehow.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:52
You know, the majority of them had donated, or their families had donated to campaigns, or… it was a true who-you-knew kind of thing.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:00
Which really leaves a really bad taste in your mouth, but…

[Sean Burke] 19:04:00
Right.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:03
It was really designed to be like, hey, there could be…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:07
circumstances that, you know, warrant

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:10
Um, someone's, you know, conviction being overturned by the president. It's become much more…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:16
political, you know, much more connected basis, so that, in my opinion,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:20
kind of really stinks, you know? But…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:24
you know, there has to be a checks and balance for the judicial branch, so maybe that isn't the best or fairest way, you know? Maybe it should be Congress, and that becomes more complicated then?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:33
But there has to be at least one way, and that's the way the Constitution is structured.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:38
It's been that way for 240 years, so in order for us to change that,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:43
The Constitution, you'd have to be amended.

[Sean Burke] 19:04:44
I know I'm one person, and, you know, maybe my view is different in someone else's, but… I think the checks and balances for the judicial branch was…

[Sean Burke] 19:04:54
You have the district courts, you have the Court of Appeals.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:58
Yeah.

[Sean Burke] 19:04:58
You have the Supreme Court. I mean, if… Three of them come up with the same…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:04
Yeah.

[Sean Burke] 19:05:05
Uh… conviction.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:06
Right. I know. Listen, I'm right there with you, in theory,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:10
But I'm going back to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:12
putting myself in the head of the Founding Fathers. Different times, of course, right? We're talking about 240 years ago.

[Sean Burke] 19:05:17
Right.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:18
But for them, everything in government

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:22
has a checks and balance outside of the branch. So this is what they came up with, which I get, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:28
But, um, and by the way, it's not as if the, you know, well, who knows, really, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:33
I was gonna say, it's not as if President Trump can just say, oh, I went to high school with this guy, so I'm gonna, you know, pardon him. You know, in Trump's case,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:40
Maybe that is the case.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:42
But it does go through a process, so the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch, you know, Justice are the attorneys for the federal government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:48
they go through a process. They review the circumstances, and they make a recommendation to the president.

[Sean Burke] 19:05:52
Okay, okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:53
Okay, so there is some level of process that happens, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:56
Um, you know, clearly somebody that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:59
was a serial killer, you know, Ted Bundy, if you guys know who that is, although you're probably too young to know who that is. But anyway, a serial killer.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:05
you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:07
probably won't be, um, pardoned by a president, right? Because there's too much…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:13
evidence to suggest that they really are guilty, but…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:16
I'm right there with you, Sean. It's just that the Founding Fathers had to come up with a way to ensure that there was at least

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:23
one level outside of their specific branch,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:26
to, you know, kind of have some level of accountability.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:31
Somebody else had a question, but now I don't see your…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:34
box.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:06:35
It was me, um… that was kind of, like, my question. What if there were some…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:36
Oh, Jessica, yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:40
Yeah.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:06:40
You know, odd connection between Ted Bundy and the president, and he's pardoning, like, pardoning him. Is there… Any way to check that part in?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:44
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:46
You know, the Constitution says that the power…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:50
The Constitution says that the President can pardon anybody under any circumstance, so theoretically,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:55
I think Bundy's dead, yeah, I think he was electrocuted a few years ago. But anyway…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:00
if he were alive, and Trump wanted to pardon him, he could?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:04
It would stink, right? It would create all kinds of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:07
you know, issues.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:07:08
So then he really doesn't have a checks and balance at the end of the day, if he can party.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:11
No, because he serves as the checks and balance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:14
to the courts, right? It's just like, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:19
you know, there's always, like, a final arbitrator, and in this case,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:23
the president can be the arbiter. And by the way, listen,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:26
Presidential pardons don't happen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:28
that often, right? You know, it's like, it's not like thousands of people are being part of it. On average, I think a president pardons, you know, less than

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:36
200 people per a two-year term, you know, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:39
I mean, that seems like a large number, but in relation to the number of people that have been convicted, it really isn't. So it's not…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:45
And there really hasn't been in history anybody that's been super controversial.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:50
Pardons tend to be what we refer to as white-collar crimes, non-criminal.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:54
Right? In fact, I can't think of any instance where somebody who's been convicted of a violent crime

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:00
has been parted. And…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:02
Remember earlier I said that presidents don't tend to pardon people in their first term until after they're re-elected?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:08
or if they're not re-elected before they leave office.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:08:09
So, what type of pardons, I guess, the majority, you would say that you would see?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:10
Because it's a super kind of unpopular thing. Every time a president pardons somebody,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:16
Um, it's really unpopular, and people don't like it, and it creates all kinds of… so presidents tend to be very careful with it,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:23
and tend to not do it until the end of their term.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:26
But it's the end of their first term, or the end of their second term.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:29
Because it's…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:35
white-collar, for sure, tax evasion,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:38
Uh, you know…

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:08:38
Yeah, of course, yeah. Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:40
things of that nature. You know, more of the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:43
the club-fed-type crimes, you know, things that are… yeah.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:08:45
Gotcha, gotcha.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:47
I can't think of any instance, you know, when I've looked at

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:50
you know, the types of parties that occurred of any violent crime that's been pardoned by a president.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:08:55
Or maybe… or maybe somebody was one fully, uh, arrested, something like that, they might be able to, if they can get to… that channel, they might be a little too big, or sponge as well.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:04
Yeah. You know, like, you know, Clinton really got… you know, Clinton was kind of like…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:09
you know, he was president, I'm sure, before many of you were born. But anyway, President Clinton was president from 1992,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:15
to 2000.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:17
what happens during that time period that no other president had to deal with?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:22
Right? And it was really the advent of technology in a way

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:26
where information became much more accessible to people, right? So I graduated college in 1992.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:32
My first job, I worked in the state legislature of Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:36
Um, we had computers, but there was no email.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:39
Right? Your computer was basically X…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:41
Well, I wasn't even Excel spreadsheets back then, it was other spreadsheets that you used and that kind of thing, but no email, because email didn't really become…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:49
Um, you know, you know, prevalent in the workforce until the internet.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:53
Which was really in the mid-1990s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:56
My first email that I ever had in a job was in 1996, right? So I worked for 5 years.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:02
Right, and I went to school, to college, with no email, no internet, none of that kind of technology.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:07
But Clinton was president from 92 to 2000, so that was the advent of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:12
technology from that perspective. In fact, as Vice President, Al Gore,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:15
you know, often claims that he… the internet really…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:19
you know, he invented the internet, right? Because he worked with

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:23
Um, various areas within government to allow for the development of that worldwide web, as we used to call it back then in the 90s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:31
Um, which is what the WWW stands for when you…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:35
used to do a search, um, before ChatGPT.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:38
Anyway, so the internet really became prevalent, so anything that Clinton did, now all of a sudden got posted on the internet, you know? There was still no social media, of course.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:47
Um, because that was another game changer. But now news was able to circulate very widely, so every action that Clinton took, you know, kind of, like, was, uh, all over the place.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:57
So, Clinton, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:00
you know, parted a number of people, and the media started kind of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:05
connecting the dots, and a bunch of the people that were pardoned under Clinton were… Clinton had a half-brother,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:10
I forget what Clinton's brother's name was, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:14
geez, what was his name? Roger. Roger Clinton.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:16
Roger Clinton wasn't as successful as Bill Clinton. Roger, you know, kind of got into trouble and was…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:23
used drugs and got arrested a bunch of times, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:26
Anyway, a bunch of the people that Clinton pardoned turned out to be friends of Roger Clinton that, you know, were in jail for…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:32
drugs, selling drugs, or possession, or something like that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:36
Um, but it was really the first time where pardons really, like, started to bubble up, and people were like, what? This is crazy, you know? It's like…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:42
It's who you know kind of thing. You know, here are, like, these 10 guys got pardoned,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:45
Because they were friends of Roger Clinton, who, you know, got himself into trouble, but because he's brothers with the president,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:50
These guys all of a sudden got… got pardoned, but um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:54
So yeah, I agree, you know, it tends not to pass the smell test, right? It tends to stink a little bit.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:01
Um, it was intended to serve as the one area outside the judicial branch that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:04
could serve as a checks and balance, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:07
You know, it is what it is. But again, presidents tend not to use it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:11
Because they know how unpopular it is. Even…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:14
Trump, right? At the end of his first term, he really didn't pardon many people. Bush, before

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:19
you know, President Bush pardoned nobody, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:22
Um, the Republicans tend to pardon less than the Democrats.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:27
Democratic presidents tend to, you know, be more, um, socially open-minded about those kinds of things.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:34
Where the Republicans tend to be much more hardcore about it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:37
Um, so Trump didn't really pardon anybody. We'll see at the end of this term, you know, what happens.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:43
So, you know, it's just… it's just one of those things. I know it's unpopular,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:47
But it is what it is, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:50
Okay,

[Merline Fenelon] 19:12:51
Did he pardon the J6 people, Trump?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:55
I think he did start to pardon some of those. Google… who asked that question, uh, Merlin?

[Merline Fenelon] 19:13:00
Merlene, yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:01
Now, do me a favor, Google it, or I'm sorry, you guys don't Google. I'm old school.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:05
ChatGPT, check it however you guys check stuff, but check to see how many people… we'll wait for you.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:13:06
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:11
Check to see how many people has President Trump pardoned, and what kind of cases were those.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:13:16
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:16
Now I guess I'm on mute.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:13:17
Actually, actually, part of everybody that was on the riot. If I don't all those guys.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:21
He did, he did a communal…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:23
Pardon?

[Merline Fenelon] 19:13:25
Yeah, because he, um, there was a big thing going around that, um.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:13:29
All the ones that he had pardoned for the J6, some of them did not accept it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:33
Yeah.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:13:34
And some of them did.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:36
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:38
Okay, all right, so there you have it, you know, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:43
Okay, so he pardoned all of those people, you know, for that. I don't know how many people there were, you know, in that instance, but um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:50
There you have it, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:53
Does anybody find, specifically, anybody else?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:56
Or anybody else that he pardoned?

[Merline Fenelon] 19:14:01
Caught in two wrappers, like Kodak and, um… Coda Black, and um… what's his name? Lil Wayne. That was a big one going around.

[Melaya Sippio] 19:14:04
Yes, I can go to what?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:11
Yeah.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:14:11
That's… that was on his first term. Yeah, that was Trump.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:13
Okay. That was, uh, Trump?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:17
Okay.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:14:18
So, upon looking, on his first term, he pardoned between 100… It was $237, but they had an issue with it, so it… but only it was 143 to 94. That was, like.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:28
Yeah.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:14:34
Included, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:35
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:37
Okay, yeah, so that's on average, presidents per term tend to… that's about…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:41
Sounds about right, the right number. You know, we'll see… had he any this term that you can see?

[Merline Fenelon] 19:14:47
Um, on his second term, pretty much the whole J6 was, like, $1,600, it says.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:52
Oh, um, okay. Well, then he's blown back, you know.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:56
That average, there you go. So he did a communal collective pardon. So, okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:00
I didn't realize that many people had been convicted, but, um…

[Merline Fenelon] 19:15:01
Yeah. In a couple of his, um, buddies, like, um, former, um, Illinois governor and farmer Virginia sheriff, and a couple other people that he knows privately.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:12
Okay. Right. Yeah, those… those clear political connections, so…

[Merline Fenelon] 19:15:18
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:19
All right. All right. Well, there you have it. So, we'll spend more time on that when we get to the chapter on the president, so again,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:24
I know, for most of us, it stinks, it really does, but um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:28
It is what it is, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:30
Alright, let me move on then. Let's, uh, kind of transition now to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:35
state governments.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:37
So, state governments have their own form of government that are governed by state constitutions.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:42
Uh, the job of a state government is to pass laws and provide services for the residents of that particular state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:49
Every state, right, is governed by their own constitution. Those constitutions are modeled after the U.S. Constitution. So if you look at the Constitution of the state of Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:59
The structure of it is very similar to the U.S. Constitution, but clearly the state constitutions then kind of start providing more detail into the specifics of that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:08
respective state. However,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:11
Every state constitution

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:13
Right? Um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:15
It creates 3 branches of government, just like at the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:19
So the state of Florida constitution…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:22
creates a legislative branch, an executive branch, and a judicial branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:27
The legislative branch in the state of Florida, their job

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:30
is to pass laws for the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:33
Right? The executive branch…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:36
For this state of Florida, their job is to provide services for those individuals in the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:42
And then the judicial branch in each of the states, um, their job is to provide

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:48
legal interpretations.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:51
Um, you know, for the state of Florida. So let's look at each of those.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:56
a little more specifically.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:59
So, in the state of Florida, the legislative branch is called the Florida Legislature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:03
Remember, at the federal level, it's called the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:08
In the States, it's called, in our case, the Florida Legislature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:11
Okay? Different names.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:13
The executive branch at the state level, the head of the executive branch is called the governor.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:19
So at the federal level, it's the president?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:22
in the executive branch, it's the governor,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:25
At the federal level, it's the Vice President of the United States,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:27
In the States, it's the lieutenant Governor. By Lieutenant Governor, we mean, you know, next in charge, okay?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:33
Um, and then at the federal level, you have these federal agencies and departments, whereas in the state, you have

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:41
you know, departments and agencies that focus on that particular state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:44
Right? And then the judicial branch at the state level

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:48
is just the state court. So here in Florida, we have a state court system

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:53
Which is just the courts. So let's take a look at each of these three areas.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:57
a little bit closer.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:59
So the Florida legislature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:02
Their job is to pass laws in the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:05
The laws that are passed by the Florida legislature

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:08
only apply in the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:12
If the Florida legislature passes a law, it has no bearing whatsoever in the state of California, or in Texas, or in Maine, or in Hawaii, or anywhere else.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:20
Just like the state laws passed in California,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:24
have no relevance anywhere else, unless you are visiting that state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:29
Right? So, the state legislatures are structured just

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:34
like the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:37
They're bicameral legislatures.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:39
Right, and this is where it gets a little confusing, I think, for a lot of people, because the state legislatures

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:44
Since they're bicameral legislative bodies,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:48
They, too, have a Senate and a House.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:50
different than the U.S. Senate, and different than the U.S. House.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:54
Right? Because the Florida legislature, bicameral,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:56
is comprised of the Florida Senate,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:00
Florida House of Representatives, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:02
The Florida Senate has nothing to do with the United States Senate. Other than that name that they share, Senate,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:07
They have nothing to do with one another, because the United States Senate

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:11
They meet in Washington, D.C.,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:13
And the laws of the U.S. Senate passes?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:16
apply to the entire country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:18
The Florida Senate, they meet in Tallahassee.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:21
And the laws that they pass only apply to those of us here in the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:26
They're completely two different bodies. They share that name,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:29
Right? They're both Senates.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:31
At the federal level, it's the United States Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:34
At the state level, in our case, it's the Florida Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:37
But other than sharing that name,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:39
They had nothing to do with one another.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:41
Right? They do their work in the same way,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:44
But the laws passed by the Florida Senate only apply to the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:48
The laws passed by the U.S. Senate only apply to the entire country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:52
Okay. Floor…

[Abiel Pedre] 19:19:54
Got a question on that one. So, those members of the Senate, so they never got a chance to go to Washington, D.C, sometimes to meet with the other members?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:55
Yeah.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:20:04
Or they just stay in Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:05
If you're a member of the Florida Senate, you could go to Washington, D.C. and meet with, you know, Senator Scott or Senator Moody.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:12
Right? But you're not… you don't vote in the U.S. Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:15
Right? You're just like anybody else. You could go meet with Senator Scott or Senator Moody, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:20
You… but… but the work of each other doesn't interact, because…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:25
who they benefit are completely different.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:28
The U.S. senators, the work they do collectively with the other senators from the other states,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:32
applies to the entire country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:35
The work that the Florida Senate does only applies to Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:38
So it's different people, right? So, Rick Scott and Ashley Moody are the two U.S. Senators that represent the state of Florida in the U.S. Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:46
They have nothing to do with the Florida Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:48
they don't go to the meetings in Tallahassee, they don't vote,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:52
at those meetings in Tallahassee,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:54
Right? Because they're in Washington, D.C., at the national level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:57
Versus the Florida Senate is in Tallahassee, only focusing on issues dealing with the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:04
So, different constitu… different people, and different constituents.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:07
U.S. Senate focuses nationally, and those

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:11
Two U.S. senators that represent each state,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:14
are in Washington, D.C., and they are not members

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:17
of the Florida Legislature or the Florida Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:19
Jessica?

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:21:21
Yeah, so my little confusion with that is… so whatever the U.S. Federal Senate.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:21:27
They… whatever law… or whatever Congress laws they pass. It doesn't… we can basically kind of override or edit them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:31
Yeah.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:21:36
And completely change them in Florida because of our senators.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:38
No. Absolutely not. The Constitution doesn't allow that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:42
There is a specific article in the Constitution which we'll get to, um, it's called the Supremacy Clause.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:48
Um, it's the sixth article of the Constitution, which states that if there's ever a conflict between a federal and or state and or local law,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:58
The government that represents a larger number of people, that law will always prevail.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:03
our case in the United States,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:05
Any federal law will always supersede any state law, and any state law will always supersede any local law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:11
Right? It's not to insinuate that the larger government's more important,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:15
But because we're a democracy,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:18
Its intent is that a government that represents a greater number of people

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:23
should always supersede a government that represents a smaller group of people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:28
So any federal law in place, any law that's passed by the United States Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:33
will always supersede any state law or any local law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:36
Okay, and it's just… it's the structure, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:39
It happens, right? You have, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:42
The Constitution…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:45
allows states… Evelyn, I'll get to your question in a sec.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:48
The Constitution allows states

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:50
to basically legislate over anything that's not a federal law. It's the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, it's called the State's Reserved Powers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:58
And under that 10th Amendment to the Constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:00
The states can pass any law about anything,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:03
As long as there isn't an existing federal law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:06
However, the Tenth Amendment

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:09
the Constitution also states that even though states have the right to do that,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:13
If a federal law is passed,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:16
that federal law will supersede the state law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:18
So I'm going to give you a couple of examples.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:21
Right now, you have a lot of differences in states on a lot of different things. For example,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:27
you know, in the state of Florida, recreational marijuana is not permitted. Medicinal marijuana is.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:33
Right? So if you have a prescription, you can purchase it legally, you know, however that happens.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:38
But recreational marijuana is not permitted.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:40
But if you go to California, it is.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:43
Or if you go to Nevada, it is. Those states allow

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:47
The use of recreational marijuana.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:49
Right? So, the state of California has a

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:54
past, Allah says that it's permissible there. The state of Florida doesn't allow it, right? So if you are…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:59
In Miami, you can't… there aren't places where you can go buy recreational marijuana, legally, I mean, of course, I'm sure.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:06
Not that you… any of you do it, but I'm sure there are places where people can go buy that stuff, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:10
In California, there are legal places where you can go purchase marijuana for recreational use. You know, you don't need a prescription, you can use it recreationally.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:19
So there's an instance where Florida…

[Merline Fenelon] 19:24:21
Question…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:21
doesn't allow something, whereas California does. Let me, uh, Merlin, I'll… let me finish, and then I'll… I'll go to, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:29
Evelyn, and then I'll go to you.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:24:29
Go ahead.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:31
You know, so there's an instance where something is not permitted in one state, and it is permitted in another state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:37
If… and that only happens because there's no federal law,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:41
that, um, does or doesn't allow marijuana.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:45
If the federal government, if the United States Congress tomorrow

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:49
passed a law that said, hey, effective October 1,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:52
Recreational marijuana is not permitted.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:55
in the United States, then that means Florida's fine, because it's not

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:59
permitted here, but that means states that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:02
do permit it, like California,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:04
That means that they have to now say, hey, effective October 1, it's no longer legal in California.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:10
You can't punish anybody. You know, on October 2nd,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:13
the Trump administration can't say, aha, we have footage of those crazy Californians, you know, smoking marijuana, you know, so it's illegal to do that, so we're gonna arrest them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:22
What they did it before October 1,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:25
And it was legal, then the government can't do that, because the Constitution doesn't allow that. There's a provision that doesn't allow that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:31
But going forward, then that would be a problem.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:34
Right? Federal laws always supersede state laws and or local laws, right?

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:25:34
Oh, okay, got it

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:39
Same thing with state law versus local law. If the city of Miami had a law in place,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:44
And then the state of Florida passed a law that conflicted with that law in Miami.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:48
the Florida law would supersede the city law. Evelyn, let me go to you first, and then I'll open it up to others.

[Evelyn Ordonez] 19:25:55
Uh, my question was about, um… the U.S. Senate Representatives for Florida.

[Evelyn Ordonez] 19:26:02
Um, when they have a hand in passing law, who are they reconvening with in Florida?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:08
Yeah, alright. I will get to that, right? So give me a sec, because I'm going to talk about who the 40…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:14
Senators are, and who the 120 representatives are. So, give me a sec.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:19
Let me get to Merlin, I'll get to you and others, and then we'll keep going.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:26
Marlene… Marlene, you still have a question?

[Merline Fenelon] 19:26:28
Um. I forgot. Yeah, it was about the, um, the whole marijuana thing. So…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:35
Okay.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:26:36
I know it's legal. In part of California.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:41
Harderol.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:26:42
All of California. So do… But is it mostly for just… Medical use only, or…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:43
Right, okay.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:26:50
Regular. Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:51
No, in California,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:53
It is permissible not only for medicinal purposes, so you can have a prescription and get it

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:58
wherever those dispensaries are.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:01
But it's also for recreational. You know, you can go and just…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:04
you. You don't have a medical condition?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:07
Um, you go into one of these stores, and you just… you purchase it. You know, you have to adhere to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:12
You can't be within a, you know, X number of feet within a school, and, you know, there's certain restrictions that you have to adhere to.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:19
But, um, there's… you can go do it. You know, there's nothing… it's like going to a liquor store, you know? If you're of age,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:27
You can go purchase…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:29
alcohol, you know, and consume it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:32
you know, wherever you're allowed to per state law, right? You can consume it while you're driving, or you can't do it in a school, or something like that, you know, but…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:40
There's certain provisions that you have to adhere to. So, recreational marijuana is permissible in

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:44
I think almost half of the states in the country. You know, you can go and purchase it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:48
What it doesn't mean, however, because the Constitution doesn't allow this specifically, there's a provision that doesn't allow it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:55
the full faith and credit clause. You can't go to California.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:59
Purchase marijuana, legally, right, because you can do it legally there,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:03
Put it in your car and drive to Florida, and then use it in Florida, and if you get caught in Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:08
you know, you…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:10
Tell the officer, hey, look, I bought this legally in Los Angeles, here's my receipt, you know, and it's legal to buy it there.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:16
Because what'll happen there is the officer and then the court will tell you, well, listen,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:20
That's fine. It's legal in California, but it's not legal in Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:24
So, everything in the legal circumstance is about where the act takes place.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:29
So if you were, you know, using marijuana in the state of Florida, and it's not legal here, even though where you purchased it it was legal,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:37
where you were using it, it's not legal, so therefore you're accountable here. You know, so under the full faith and

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:43
Credit provision of the Constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:45
That's not permissible, right? It's where you commit the act

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:49
That determines whether or not you will be held accountable or not.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:52
You know? I'll give you another example, kind of related, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:56
Not many states at this point. I think Nevada is the only state that allows

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:01
Legally, prostitution, right? So if you go to the state of Nevada,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:06
Um, all except for Clark County, which is where Las Vegas is, every other county in Nevada

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:11
Prostitution's legal for both males and females.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:13
But, you know, you can fly into Vegas and then take a…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:16
Drive out to whatever county is outside of Clark County, and

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:19
go to a brothel, whether it's male or female, and hire a prostitute, and it's legal, right? You can't be arrested in Nevada for it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:26
Because the state allows it, they regulate it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:29
So, let's say you do that, and, you know, maybe what happens in Vegas doesn't necessarily stay in Vegas, and you come back home, and somehow there's a video, or a picture or something of you in this brothel,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:39
And now the state of Florida says, aha!

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:41
you know, you were with a prostitute, and that's not legal.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:44
Well, too bad, because where you committed the act, it was legal, so therefore, under the Constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:51
the state of Florida has no bearance in, you know, holding you accountable for something that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:56
If you committed it legally somewhere,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:58
you know, you can't be held liable someplace else for it. So if you committed the act of…

[Merline Fenelon] 19:29:58
Mm-hmm.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:03
prostituting, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:05
legally in Nevada, then when you go to Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:09
Okay, as long as you don't do the act of prostitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:12
In Florida, then you're fine, right? Because it's where you commit the act.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:16
Okay.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:30:17
So it's pretty much just, like, jurisdiction. Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:20
Correct. Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:22
Jessica, you had a question, I think, maybe? Or was…

[Merline Fenelon] 19:30:24
Thank you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:25
earlier.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:30:26
Your answer, that was the whole reason why you were talking, that was my question. Thank you very much.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:28
Okay. No worries. Okay, let me keep moving, guys, and then we'll entertain some other questions. So let me kind of finish here with the Florida Legislature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:36
So we got the Florida Senate, right? There's 40…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:39
members of the Florida Senate, I'll tell you who those people are in a second.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:42
And then in addition, you have the Florida House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:46
Of which there are 120.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:48
Uh, in the Florida House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:51
Florida House of Representatives, if you're a member, if you're one of these 120 members, you have nothing to do with the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:57
and the United States House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:59
Right? Remember, there's 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives, of which there are…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:05
About 29 that represent the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:07
Those 29 members in the U.S. House of Representatives who represent the state of Florida have nothing to do with the Florida House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:14
Right? Because those U.S. House of Representatives members, they meet in Washington, D.C.,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:19
And they're part of a body that passes laws for the entire country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:22
Versus the 120 members that are part of the Florida House of Representatives,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:28
They meet in Tallahassee, and they pass laws only for the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:33
Right? So other than sharing that name, House of Representatives,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:36
they don't have anything else in common. Two completely different bodies, two completely different set of people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:43
at the U.S. level, those people, whether it's the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:48
They passed laws at the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:50
They do that in Washington, D.C.,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:52
And once a law is approved by the President, it applies to everybody in the country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:57
The people here in Florida, whether it's the 40 Florida Senators or the

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:01
120 House… Florida House of Representatives,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:03
Their job is to pass laws only for Florida. Whatever laws they pass here,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:09
have nothing to do in California or Texas, or at the U.S. level, or anything other than in the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:16
Okay? Alright, let me show you who these people are.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:19
So what happens is Florida has approximately 22 million people, um, that the most recent census count

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:27
accounted for. Um, so the Florida…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:31
Constitution. What it does for the Florida legislature is, in the Senate, the Florida Senate, this is the Florida Senate map, right? There's 40 districts,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:41
What the Florida Constitution says is, hey, you take the… every 10 years,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:45
You take the number of people that the U.S. Census has counted in the state of Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:50
And you divide that number into 40 districts,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:54
And those districts represent approximately

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:57
the same number of people per district. That's why you see on this map, you see different sizes of the districts,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:03
So even though geographically the sizes are different, the number of people that live within those districts are approximately the same. Currently, it's about a half a million people

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:13
that live in each one of those districts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:15
So you can look at District 3, right? And it's a pretty large area.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:19
There's about half a million people that live in District 3, versus…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:24
District 33.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:27
Right? That's here in South Florida somewhere, that's probably, like, Broward County. You know, District 40.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:32
District 37, different District 38, you know, each of those districts geographically are much smaller,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:38
But that means there's about half a million people that live in those districts. You know, Miami-Dade County has…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:42
a lot more people. We have 3 million people versus, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:46
District 3 probably is comprised of, like, 3 different counties, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:50
Um, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:52
There are 40 districts, as determined by the Florida Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:57
Every 10 years, you kind of reassign the district based on where the population is,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:02
So that every district represents about approximately the same number of people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:08
Right? So there's 40 districts in the state of Florida for the Florida Senate,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:12
That means that if you live in that district, you guys, your homework assignment, this was one of your questions, who is your Florida State representative? I'm sorry, who's your Florida State Senator?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:22
Well, that depends for most of us, you know, because I live…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:25
Maybe in a different district than where Evelyn or Jessica live.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:29
You know, so you're a state senator…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:32
may be different for many of us in this class, depending on where you live. You know, if you live in Homestead,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:37
And I live in Miami Lakes, we're gonna have a different…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:40
Senator, right? Because we live in different districts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:43
Okay? Um, if I live in Miami Lakes, and I have 3 children that live in Tallahassee,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:48
They have a different state senator that represents them, right? Because clearly, Tallahassee's in District 3,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:54
Right? And I live in District, uh…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:56
40, I believe. Yeah, I'm in District 40.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:59
Right? So we have a dip… we're different districts, therefore we have a different state senator that represents us, alright?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:05
There's elections every four years for state senators, believe it or not. If you're eligible to vote, you're eligible to vote for a state senator every 4 years, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:14
So hopefully now, after you've completed your homework assignment, you know who your state senator is.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:21
Did anybody have any…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:23
issues finding their state senator?

[Merline Fenelon] 19:35:26
I'm having issues with my… it's me, Marlene. I'm having issues with mine, because, um… I'm in North Miami.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:31
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:34
Okay.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:35:36
And… I… Because from what I've found…

[Merline Fenelon] 19:35:42
State Senator… Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:43
I'm gonna look it up real quick for you.

[Sean Burke] 19:35:53
I think it's 7, uh, Jones.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:54
Yeah, Chevron Jones. I'm gonna… I'm pretty sure it's Chevron Jones, but I'm gonna check.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:35:57
I'm so sorry, repeat.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:59
Chevron Jones.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:36:03
Devon Jones. Sherry? Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:04
No, Chevron.

[Sean Burke] 19:36:06
I'm putting it in the chat.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:11
Yeah, it could be Pizzo or Chevron, or Jones, because Senator Pizzo and, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:16
Jones kind of, like, they're… depending on where you live, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:19
You'd probably have to put in your actual address for you to, um, to determine, but I believe in North Miami,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:26
It's Chevron Jones.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:36:27
Okay.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:36:28
Followed a heel, I found, uh, Wazalin was good. I don't know if it's the correct one.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:34
Who?

[Abiel Pedre] 19:36:34
Or not. Was that Lynn… was that Lynn Osgood? For District 32, Notre Hill.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:40
District 22?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:43
Oh, 32.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:36:43
32. Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:46
Uh, where do you live?

[Abiel Pedre] 19:36:50
Oh, look at him.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:50
Oh, you're like, here at Broward. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'm more familiar with the ones in Miami-Dade County, so, um, yeah, okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:56
Yeah, actually, Merlin, you're probably districts, uh…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:01
You're on the coast, nearly, so you're probably, like, District 37, so you can check that way, but…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:07
Um, but there should… I think if you go to Florida Senate site,

[Merline Fenelon] 19:37:07
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:12
There should… this is just the map, but there should be a way you can populate the address, and it should be able to find it for you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:19
Yeah.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:37:19
So you said Florida Senate? Okay. Thank you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:25
Alright, let me go back. Actually, I think I can get rid of the White House now.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:31
In the Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:35
Alright, so let's look at the map for the Florida House of Representatives, because there are 120 districts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:40
right in the Florida House of Representatives. So, same thing, what happens is the Constitution of the state of Florida says that, um,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:48
Let me find the map.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:52
That's true.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:53
Hold on one sec… I thought this would have taken me directly to the map.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:03
House majority…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:07
I guess this will tell me who…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:13
No, it's not what it wants.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:27
That'd be something for maps. Ah, here we go.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:33
Alright, so the state of constitution divides the Florida House of Representatives into 120 districts. So what happens is, after the census count, you take that 22 million,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:42
You divide it by 120, and I…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:44
think, don't quote me on this, it's not important.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:47
I think each district is about 300,000 people, right? So you can take a look, again, look at District 7,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:54
Right? Versus, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:57
Look at… in South Florida, right? Like, District 119, 118, 114.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:02
You know, uh, those are much smaller geographically,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:05
Because that means that every district has about 300,000 people, so clearly, the more populated areas, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:14
The districts are smaller,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:17
Um, because each representative represents about 300,000. So clearly, like, District 7,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:24
Right, where is… I'm trying to find where Leon County is.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:30
Because it must be 9.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:34
Anyway, yeah, I guess it's 9. Um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:37
you know, it's just… it's based on population. So, um, so these just are creating. So that means that if you live in that district,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:44
Right? You get to vote for your representative.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:46
And that representative represents you in the state of Florida House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:51
And just like…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:53
at the United States level,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:56
The…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:59
work that the Florida legislature does.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:02
Florida Senate and the Florida House of Representatives.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:04
Even though they work independently of each other, in order for a law to pass out of the Florida legislature that would then apply to the state of Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:12
they'd have to do it jointly.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:14
So both the Senate in Florida and the House in Florida

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:17
have to work together in order for their law to pass, and then apply to all the states.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:23
I'm sorry, all the residents in the state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:26
So the structure at the federal level in the U.S. Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:30
And at the state level, in the Florida legislature, is the same

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:34
However, the people are different.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:37
Right? If you're a United States Senator, you're not a member of the Florida Senate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:41
If you're a Florida House of Representatives,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:45
Remember, you're not a member of the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:47
House of Representatives, right? So it's different people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:51
And who the laws that they pass apply to are different as well.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:55
The laws applied by the Congress?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:58
United States Congress, U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:01
applies to everybody in the country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:04
The laws passed by the Florida legislature,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:07
only apply to those of us living here in the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:10
Does that make sense to everybody?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:12
I know it's confusing, right? Because you're talking about Senate and House.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:17
But if anything you hear today, just know that…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:22
It's just, like, you know, Smith, right? There's a lot of Smiths.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:25
all over the world, right? But they may not be related in any way, shape, or form, they just happen to share a name.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:32
That's the case here.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:33
The United States government has a legislative branch, it's called the United States Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:38
The state of Florida has a legislative branch, it's called the Florida Legislature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:42
The U.S. Congress is bicameral, meaning there's a U.S. Senate and U.S. House.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:47
Florida legislature is bicameral, meaning there's a Florida Senate and a Florida House.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:51
Right? The names are similar, however, the work

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:55
that the U.S. Congress, through the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House, too,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:59
applies to everybody in the country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:02
And the work that the Florida Legislature, through the Florida Senate and the Florida House of Representatives, only applies to here in the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:09
And the people that are part of the U.S. Senate

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:12
versus the Florida Senate are completely different people. They have nothing to do with each other. They may not even know each other.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:18
Maybe they do, maybe they're friends, they play golf, or go shopping, or watch football games together, but maybe they don't. But they have nothing to do with each other,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:26
in their roles as U.S. Senators,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:29
And as Florida Senators.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:31
Same thing with the U.S. House of Representatives versus the Florida House of Representatives. If you're a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, you have nothing to do

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:39
with the Florida House of Representatives. Completely different people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:42
They may or may not know each other. It doesn't matter, because professionally, with what they do,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:46
They're a completely different bodies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:49
Okay?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:51
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:54
I'm going to move on to the executive branch at the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:00
Right? Just at the federal level,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:03
The executive branch acts as the area of government in Florida, in every state,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:10
whereby the services are delivered to the residents of the state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:13
Okay. Luckily,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:15
The CEO of the state executive branches is not called the President of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:22
Right? They are called governors. So we don't mix up the President of the United States

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:27
and the governors of every state, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:30
Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump maybe or maybe don't look alike, but we're not going to mix them up.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:34
We know that Donald Trump is the President of the U.S., and Ron DeSantis is the governor of the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:40
Right? Gavin Newsom is the governor of California. We're not going to mix him up with Ron DeSantis.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:45
They're both nice-looking guys, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:47
But you're not gonna mix them up. You know who Ron DeSantis is, and you know who Gavin Newsom is.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:51
You're not going to mix up Gavin Newsom with President Trump. Completely different. So luckily,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:56
At that, um, from this perspective, the CEOs of the country versus the CEOs of the state

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:02
It's not hard to mix them up.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:04
But the governor's function, very much like the president of the state, right? They are that CEO.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:10
They are the elected official whose job it is to ensure that the services of the state of Florida are being delivered.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:17
Okay? The executive branch also includes a lieutenant Governor. The lieutenant Governor functions much like the VP of the state, right? They're second in command if something happens to the governor, the lieutenant governor assumes the responsibilities.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:29
They, uh, they help with the work that the governor is doing.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:34
Um, so they are part of that executive branch and the team that provides those services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:39
And then every state has their own, uh, departments and agencies that are part of that state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:45
that only deliver services to that state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:48
Okay? So, you know…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:50
This is an area that I think confuses people, too, because, for example,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:55
In the state of Florida, Florida has a Florida Department of Agriculture.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:00
Their job is to ensure that all of the produce, all of the livestock that, you know, is in the state of Florida

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:06
is safe and is regulated and all that kind of stuff.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:10
Well, the United States also happens to have a

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:13
Department of Agriculture, right? It's called the USDA, the United States Department of Agriculture.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:18
The job of the USDA is to make sure that, as a country,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:23
All of the produce and the livestock and all that kind of stuff that there's national regulations, and that there's coordination that happens, and so forth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:31
So here… here you have, you know, the United States Department of Agriculture,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:35
And the Florida Department of Agriculture. What's the difference?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:38
Well, the difference is the work of the Florida

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:41
Department of Agriculture is to only focus on the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:44
you know, Florida is the largest producer

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:47
of, uh, livestock.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:50
and of produce in the country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:51
More so than California, more so than Texas, more so than any other state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:56
Right, so the Florida Department of Agriculture is huge!

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:59
in the state of Florida. They have a lot of work that they have to do.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:02
Right? So they work

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:04
you know, jointly with the USDA?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:07
on stuff, but… but the

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:09
focus of the Florida Department of Agriculture is in the state of Florida, right? They had nothing to do with California, or Texas, or Hawaii, or any of those other states.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:17
Because those states have their own state departments of agriculture that focus on whatever

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:22
It is that those states produce, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:25
Um, a Department of Education.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:28
You know, you have the Florida Department of Education, whose job it is to focus on the schools here in Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:33
But then you have the U.S. Department of Education.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:36
Right? So, U.S. Department of Education coordinates amongst all 50 states.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:42
Whereas the respective State Department

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:45
Uh, I'm sorry.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:47
respective state departments of education focus on those particular states, right? So the Florida Department of Education focuses on all the schools in the state of Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:56
And they work in coordination with the U.S. Department of Education,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:01
Um, but the work that the Department of Education does in the state of Florida has nothing to do with the Department of Education in Georgia, or North Carolina, or Virginia.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:08
or any other state. Those states have their own

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:11
independent, uh, departments of education.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:13
Okay. All right, so that's the executive branch, right? So people…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:19
At least at the CEO level, we tend not to confuse the governors with the president.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:24
What may be confusing for some people

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:27
between the states and the federal government is

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:29
the various departments that have similar names,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:33
But just know that if it's a…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:35
a federal department, it's always going to be the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:39
The U.S. Department of Education.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:41
The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:44
It's a State Department,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:46
it's gonna be the Florida Department of Agriculture.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:49
the California Department of Education.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:51
the North Carolina Department of Veterans Affairs, right? That's the difference.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:55
U.S. focuses on the entire country,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:58
and the respective states focus on their respective states.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:02
Alright, and then lastly,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:04
the judicial branch at the state level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:07
Alright, just like at the federal level, we have courts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:11
in state government. So, Sean, I'm going to ask you this since you answered the last question, right? So…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:16
At the federal level, the federal courts handle violation of federal laws passed by

[Sean Burke] 19:48:20
She always texted me about…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:22
the U.S. Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:24
What cases would go to a state court, you think?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:27
Versus a federal court.

[Sean Burke] 19:48:30
State cases. So, like. Uh, yeah, the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:31
Right, exactly. The state laws. We just gave a lot of examples, right? California allows recreational marijuana, Florida doesn't.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:38
So if you're busted in Orlando for selling, I don't know,

[Sean Burke] 19:48:38
Exactly.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:43
10 pounds, or I'm not quite sure of what the measurements are, but you know, a lot of marijuana, right, more than the legal

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:49
amount that can be sold legally, I guess.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:52
Um, you know, you would be charged with a state crime. It's not a federal crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:56
Right? So federal courts only handle violation of federal laws that have been passed by the state's Congress.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:49:01
Okay. I've got a question on that one. Can a quant be both federal and state at the same time?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:03
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:08
No. There's no way that could be, because…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:13
the Supremacy Clause, which is Article 6 of the Constitution, doesn't allow that. It says that if there's ever any conflict in law,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:22
then the federal law's always going to prevail. Now,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:24
What could happen, and maybe what you're referring to, Abel, is that

[Abiel Pedre] 19:49:24
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:28
Could you be charged? Could you commit something that's both

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:32
a federal crime, and in addition to that federal crime, a state crime. So, for example,

[Abiel Pedre] 19:49:38
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:39
Could you be in a hotel room in Orlando?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:43
And be busted with, you know, a million dollars of counterfeit money.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:48
that you were running a prostitution ring with.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:51
Okay, so there now you have…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:54
Um, there's a concept in law called time, place, and matter.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:58
you know, when you are accused of a crime,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:01
You go through when, what, how, who, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:05
who committed the crime toward whom,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:07
And you determine, is it a violation of a federal law?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:10
or a state law. It could be…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:12
that you are both in violation of a federal law, and in addition to that,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:16
Also in violation to a state law. So in that case, I just gave you that I made up,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:20
you know, you're in a hotel room in Orlando, you're running a prostitution ring at the same time, you are, you know, laundering counterfeit money.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:28
There you have a violation of a federal law, which is the counterfeiting of money.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:33
And you have a violation of a state law, which is the prostitution side.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:37
But you could be accused of that federal crime,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:39
counterfeiting, at the same time accused of a state crime,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:43
Not counterfeiting, because that can't be a state crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:45
But of prostitution, so you would be tried separately for both those crimes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:50
Is that maybe what you meant?

[Abiel Pedre] 19:50:50
I'll show you what. Actually, I know somebody that, uh, he did 5 years under federal.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:50:55
And now he's doing the remaining… and state, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:58
Right, right, because that's similar like that. They were charged with a federal crime, and in addition,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:51:03
also charged with a state crime and found guilty in both cases.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:51:06
Yeah, so that happens. Jessica.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:51:09
Is that what's kind of going on with, um… what is it in, Luigi Mangioni, that in New York?

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:51:16
That he's being charged not as a terrorist, because it's going on in New York, there's certain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:51:23
Yeah.

[Jessica Mursuli] 19:51:23
Statue definition of limitations.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:51:25
Well, so let's look at that case, if you're familiar with it, you know, this guy, young man, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:51:30
college age, I guess he was dealing with college, but anyway, young guy, 20s.

[Sean Burke] 19:51:33
Can you give his name again? Sorry

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:51:35
Luigi Mangioni, I believe? He's the guy that is accused of killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:51:42
back about a year and a half ago, he was a, you know, in New York City, the CEO of this healthcare company that was gunned down.

[Sean Burke] 19:51:49
I remember that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:51:49
And then…

[Merline Fenelon] 19:51:50
But is it New York has… different laws for different crimes that they have, because they're, like, a whole different, um, jurisdiction.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:00
Well, New York has state laws?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:03
And then they're also… but they have federal laws that they have to adhere to that are applicable to everybody in the entire country, right? But they have state laws, right? I mean, you can't kill somebody in New York, that's a…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:12
That's a violation of a state law.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:52:15
Yeah, because I know, um, because I'm originally from New York, because they have, like, four, um, bureaus, and I know every bureau have their own, like, um, rules and regulations.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:21
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:26
Yes, but you're getting ahead of yourself, because that's local governments, right?

[Sean Burke] 19:52:27
But that's, like… That's municipality level, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:31
So you have…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:33
Correct, that's…

[Merline Fenelon] 19:52:33
But with him, due to the fact that he… I know he was… he lived in, what.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:52:39
Not in… long. He lives in Maryland, but he did the crime in the city.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:40
It was from Maryland.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:45
New York City, Manhattan. Yeah.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:52:46
In my hand. So, with Manhattan. Laws, because it's a different bureau.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:53
No.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:52:53
How… how are he's gonna get charged? Is he gonna get charged with Manhattan laws, or, um, where he from?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:55
No, no, no.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:52:57
No, no, no. No, no. The state of New York has a law that says that homicide is not permissible in the entire state of New York. So Manhattan doesn't have a different law on homicide versus

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:08
the Bronx, or Long Island, or anything like that. It's a state law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:13
Right, so he's being charged, so going back to the original question, which I think was Jessica, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:17
He's being charged with manslaughter.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:20
Okay? But in addition to that, there was a charge of domestic terrorism, right, because of the nature of his crime, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:27
He took a position, a political position, so they had argued that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:31
you know, there was a charge of domestic terrorism.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:34
Terrorism is a federal crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:37
Right? So he was being charged with a federal crime for terrorism,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:41
And at the same time, he was being charged with a state crime, which is manslaughter, you know, the homicide.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:47
They have ruled, from what I understand, that the domestic terrorism charge was dropped.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:52
Alright? That was one charge he had. He probably had many charges.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:53:56
The main charging that now he's dealing with is manslaughter. I think it's manslaughter. It could be homicide, or…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:02
you know, third-degree murder, I'm not quite sure exactly what…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:05
how he was charged for the killing of the person that he's accused of killing.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:09
So that's the main, you know, charge that he is facing now, which is a state crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:14
So, Merlin, back to your…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:16
observation, you know, different local governments…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:20
don't have laws about, um… if there's a state law,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:25
than a local jurisdiction can't govern on it. And in the state of New York, every state, every state has in place

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:31
crimes against murder, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:35
the level of murder varies from one state to another. First degree, second degree, third degree.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:39
But those are state crimes, not municipal crimes.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:54:40
Mm-hmm.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:43
He may have been charged with something else in Manhattan, you know, he may have broken a city law.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:48
or a county law in the Bureau of Manhattan.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:50
But that's a different charge. His main charge right now is murder.

[Merline Fenelon] 19:54:55
Oh, okay. Alright. Thank you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:54:58
Okay. Yeah. Alright, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:00
As Sean observed, right, so we have federal crimes, if you violate a federal law passed by the United States Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:06
You're gonna go to a federal court, which we talked about.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:09
If you violate a state crime,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:11
You know, anything that's not a federal law, states have the right to legislate over, you're going to go to a state court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:17
So, in most cases, murders are considered state crimes, right? There are some circumstances where they might be considered a federal crime. For example,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:27
If it's an act of terrorism.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:29
You guys won't remember this, but back in the 90s, there was this guy that put a bomb in a federal building, and the bomb blew up and killed

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:37
A lot of people, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:39
He was charged with federal murder.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:41
Because, um, it was two things, right? It was considered an act of terrorism. He took a political position.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:48
And it also occurred in a federal building.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:51
Right, so he was charged with federal murder, which is rare.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:55
Right? Most murders are state crimes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:55:58
Right? So let's just use an example of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:01
Hate to use his name, but we've used him before, so why not? John Smith.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:05
So John Smith is accused of killing somebody at a McDonald's.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:11
in, uh, you know, Miami Shores.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:14
Alright, so… it's a violation of a Florida law that you can't kill somebody.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:19
So he's going to be charged with a state crime.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:24
In the state of Florida, we basically have four levels of courts, right? We have our county courts, which basically deal with, um, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:33
non-criminal type of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:35
situations. You get a traffic ticket.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:37
You're going to go to a county court, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:39
You have circuit courts, of which there are 20 in the state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:42
Right? Circuit courts are the ones that, again, we're most familiar with, probably even more than the district courts at the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:49
These are the ones you really see on TV, on Law & Order,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:52
And in movies and stuff like that. The circuit courts are the basic court system, where if you're accused of a crime,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:56:58
You know, there's a judge that presides.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:00
A jury of your peers,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:03
A defense for the accused and a prosecution, which is the state of Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:07
Um, for the, uh, for the prosecution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:10
Right? One of two things will happen, you know, John Smith is accused of killing

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:16
somebody at a McDonald's in Miami Shores,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:20
They'll go to a circuit court,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:22
the case will be presented, the jury will render a verdict.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:26
If they're not guilty, then John Smith can go home and never have to deal with that nightmare again.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:31
If John is found guilty at the circuit court,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:34
He can appeal it to a Florida appellate court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:38
It's different than the federal appellate court, completely different judges,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:41
But the structure's the same, right? So it's a panel of three judges at the Florida Appellate Court,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:46
They'll review the circumstances of the, um, you know, case from the circuit court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:52
And then they will render a… either they agree,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:57:56
and upholds the guilty verdict of the circuit court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:00
Or they override that guilty verdict, and in that case, Johnny now is free to go and never has to deal with that crime again.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:07
If they uphold the Circuit Court's decision, then Johnny can appeal it to a Supreme Court,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:12
And the Supreme Court can choose as to whether or not to hear the case or not.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:16
Okay? Alright, so that's the level of quartz, you know, in the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:22
They are mirror images of the federal courts, and again, I know this creates some level of confusion,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:27
But know that the difference between the federal courts and the state courts are

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:32
Federal courts deal with violation of federal laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:36
Anything passed by the United States Congress,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:38
If you're accused of violating that federal law, you will go to a federal court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:43
Anything that's not a federal law,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:46
Any violation of any other law that's a state law will go to the state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:50
ports, okay? So the structures are identical. They are mirror images of each other, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:58:56
Circuit court is a mirror image of the District Court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:00
But different judges, right? One is a federal judge at the U.S. District Court.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:06
the Florida Circuit Courts have state judges.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:08
Right? And then the type of case is different.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:11
Federal judges will only hear violations of federal laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:15
State courts will only hear a violation of state laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:19
Right? You can go… I'm gonna… you guys have this, but you can go to this link, and it kind of gives you an overview of the Florida courts.

[Sean Burke] 19:59:25
Yeah, um, and we don't have to get too technical, it just came to mind. So… If… if someone's accused of something like…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:26
In the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:28
Sean, you got a question?

[Sean Burke] 19:59:40
Racketeering, for instance, right? Is… can I be at the state level.

[Sean Burke] 19:59:45
Or is that a federal. Like, if it's a crime syndicate, if it's…

[Sean Burke] 19:59:51
Like, they're selling more drugs than the average. Drug dealing. They're, uh, laundering more money than the average money laundering.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:59:55
Yeah.

[Sean Burke] 20:00:00
Does that become… well, money laundering is probably a federal crime anyway, but… Um, so I'll… take it back down to drugs, right? Or they're doing, like.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:03
It is, yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:07
Yeah, yeah.

[Sean Burke] 20:00:09
You know, robberies and stuff like that. Does, at some point, does that become a federal crime rather than a state crime?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:18
It could. You know, again, there's this concept called time, place, and manner. So, you know, whenever…

[Sean Burke] 20:00:22
Okay. I guess when it's starting to cross. Cross, like, state lines, it's… okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:26
Correct? Yeah, I was gonna tell you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:28
Right, so time, place, and manner, it's…

[Sean Burke] 20:00:28
All right.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:31
Where did it happen? When did it happen? By whom? Toward whom? You know, what are the circumstances? So you could have an issue where

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:38
You are now crossing state jurisdictions?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:41
In that example, and now it's a federal crime, right? Because the federal government doesn't allow that cross…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:47
state lines, you know,

[Sean Burke] 20:00:48
Okay, alright. I can't… once I started asking the question, I kind of realized where it becomes federal and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:48
So, it just… time, place, and manner depends.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:52
When, where, how, whom…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:00:56
Yeah, yeah. It really depends, you know, it's like, you look at all the circumstances, and then it could.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:03
You know, they're under circumstances, it could or it could not, you know? It's a lot of times as, like, where did the acts take place? That's the important thing.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:11
Right? Yeah.

[Sean Burke] 20:01:11
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:13
Okay, all right, so that's our… our state court system, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:19
But again, we'll spend more time on the courts. We'll have a whole class lecture on courts, mostly on the federal level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:25
And mostly on the Supreme Court level, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:27
of that, mostly on some landmark Supreme Court cases, because some of those cases are on your FCLE, so I want to spend some time on some of those really important.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:35
landmark Supreme Court cases, but nonetheless,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:38
When we get to the chapter on the courts, I'll bring back the state courts, and we'll do some juxtapositions on

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:43
federal versus state courts, so you can get a, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:46
a much better idea of what the differences are, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:51
All right, guys, so let's move now to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:55
Local governments, right? So we talked about the federal government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:01:57
We talked about state governments, now let's talk a little bit about local governments.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:02
I mentioned earlier there are over 100,000

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:07
local governments in the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:09
Um, local governments consist of a number of different types.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:14
of local governments, there are municipalities,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:17
municipalities can be cities, towns, villages, townships.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:22
Right? Any one of those is considered a municipality.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:26
Um, municipalities are geographic areas that are bounds

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:30
You know, by a certain boundary, right? So you can look at the city of Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:35
And the City of Hialeah has a boundary of, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:39
to the north, it's, you know, northwest…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:44
Or, yeah, northwest 138th Street, or…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:48
you know, West 84th Avenue in Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:52
to the west, it's the Palmetto, basically, although it's a little bit over now.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:02:57
To the east, it's East 10th Avenue, which I think is, like, Northwest 32nd Avenue.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:03
And then to the south is Okeechobee Road. You know, one of the challenges of Hialeah was they have their own numbering system, of course.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:10
Which is different than the county system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:13
Which I know creates a lot of confusion for a lot of people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:16
Anybody know why that is? Anybody know why some cities

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:20
have their own directional systems, Hialeah does.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:24
Coral Gables does, Miami Beach does.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:29
And there's the rest of Miami-Dade County. Anybody want to take classes as well?

[Sean Burke] 20:03:31
They just wanted to be different?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:35
Yeah, and it's not because they want to be different, it's because they were different

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:39
first, right? So, if you look at the history,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:42
of Miami-Dade County, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:44
I'm kind of going into the second bullet here. Um, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:48
Miami-Dade County is a county

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:51
Counties tend to be a larger jurisdiction wherein municipalities reside.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:56
So, for example, Miami-Dade County…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:03:58
has 34 municipalities within it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:01
So within Miami-Dade County, you have the City of Miami, the City of Hialeah, the City of Miami Beach, the City of Coral Gables, the City of Homestead.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:07
Bow Harbor, Surfside, Bay Harbor Islands, Aventura, Cutler Bay, Pinecrest, Key Biscayne.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:14
Doral, Hylia Gardens, Miami Springs, Miami Lakes, Miami Shores.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:20
Um, anyway, I didn't get all 34 of them, but, you know, close.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:24
So there's 34 municipalities within a county.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:26
The difference between a municipality and a county is a county tends to be a larger jurisdiction.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:31
That provides regional services to the municipalities.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:35
So here in Miami-Dade County, we have 34 cities, basically.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:39
that each provides services to their respective residents.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:43
And then Miami County is responsible for more regional assets. Like, they run the airport, Miami International Airport is a county asset.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:50
the seaport is run by the county,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:53
The library system, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:04:55
It benefits the entire county. You can check out a book at a library in Homestead and return it in Aventura.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:01
And it's the same system. Mass transit.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:04
buses, metro rail, run by Miami-Dade County, the Performing Arts Center, right? It benefits all of those municipalities in, in, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:12
in Miami-Dade County. But going back to the street system, right? Because…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:16
I think I was creating some confusion when I was talking about the boundaries of Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:19
Here's why.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:22
Some of these cities…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:24
that have their own numbering system, were around before Miami-Dade County was incorporated in 1957.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:31
Miami is the oldest city in Miami-Dade County. They were incorporated in 1898, and they developed their own street system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:36
Right? Hialeah is the second oldest city. They were, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:42
around in, like, the early 1920s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:44
Miami Beach was, like, 1925, Coral Gables was, like, 1920-something.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:49
So, early on, when those cities incorporated,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:52
There was no Miami-Dade County, right? And you really only had the city of Miami,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:05:57
the City of Miami Beach, the City of Corgables, the City of Hialeah,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:00
And each of those cities develop their own

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:03
Directional system, so that you wouldn't be confused, right? If you said, hey,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:08
Meet me at, uh, Galeano…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:11
And Lejeune. Okay, you knew that was Coral Gables.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:15
Right? Because you know that Galeano and Lejeune are in Core Gables, because they're names of people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:21
Right? Versus Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:24
Hialeah did its own numbering system that made sense for its city that was different than Miami, because that was a completely different area.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:32
Money Beach had their own system, right? They named streets after presidents. You have Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:37
Right? And then you have 1st Street on the southern end, all the way to 88th Street on the northern end, right? So it's a different numbering system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:44
So those early cities created their own numbering system,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:48
that made sense for their municipalities.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:51
And then all of a sudden, after the Second World War, where you had a population boom in Miami-Dade County,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:56
You had the creation of Miami-Dade County,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:06:58
And once Miami-Dade County established itself, it said, oh man,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:02
We gotta create a system for the entire county,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:05
So they adopted the system of the city of Miami,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:08
Since that was the largest city that existed,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:11
So the address system for the City of Miami is the one that's used in the entire county.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:17
But cities, like Coral Gables and Hialeah and Miami Beach,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:20
said, we ain't changing, right? We're gonna keep our own system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:23
So that's why you have different directional systems in some cities, you know?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:27
It gets a little confusing. I grew up in Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:30
I can tell you the first time I drove out of Hialeah, when I was old enough to drive when I was 16,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:35
you know, I'm on, uh, East 8th Avenue, and all of a sudden, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:40
The sign says Northwest 42nd Avenue. I'm like, what?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:43
Where the heck am I? Well, East 8th Avenue is the same thing as Northwest 42nd Avenue, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:48
One is the county address, one is the Hialeah address, but for me, it was super confusing, and it took me forever.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:53
to understand the street systems outside of Hialeah, because that's what I was familiar with.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:07:58
Anyway, all right, so you got Hialeah that's got its geographic boundary. If you live within that boundary, you know, between Okeechobee,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:05
And West 84th Street in Hialeah, and the Palmetto,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:09
And East 10th Avenue in Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:11
Then the services that you receive…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:14
By living in that geographic area are provided by the City of Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:18
They provide police and fire,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:21
They pick up your garbage, right? They pave your roads.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:24
They run the park systems in the city of Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:27
Right? They do the building compliance, uh, requirements that are required by the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:33
Right? All of that is done

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:35
by the city that you live in.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:37
Right? So, if you live in Miami Beach,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:39
you know, Miami Beach is easy to understand because it's an island, right? So it starts on 1st Street to the south, and it goes all the way to 88th Street to the north.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:46
And it's bound by Biscayne Bay to the west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:50
So if you live within that boundary of the city of Miami Beach,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:08:54
Miami Beach provides all its services that you need. You know, if you're in trouble and you need to call the police, it's the City of Miami Beach Police that responds.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:01
If you're not feeling well and you have to call the paramedics, it's the Miami Beach Fire Department that you call.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:06
Miami Beach picks up your garbage.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:08
They pave your roads, they run the parks,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:11
Right? They do all of those services in the city of Miami Beach for the residents and the visitors of that community.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:18
Just like that, in Miami-Dade County, there's 34 cities.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:23
Hailia, Miami Beach, Miami,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:25
Right? Now, harbors, Surfside, Aventura, Homestead, Coral Gables, Hialeah Gardens, Miami Springs, Miami Lakes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:34
You have 34 cities that take care of that. And again, the difference between a municipality, whether they're called a city, a town, or a village, it doesn't matter.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:42
Right? Cities tend to be larger in nature, like the city of Miami, the city of Hialeah, the city of Coral Gables.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:49
Um, towns and villages tend to be smaller. The village of Key Biscayne

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:52
Village of Bow Harbor, the town of Miami Lakes,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:55
town of Surfside, right? They're all municipalities at the end of the day.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:09:59
They all have a job that they have to do, which is basically to provide those basic, what we call, municipal services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:06
Police, fire, garbage pickup, road maintenance, parks.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:10
Um, all those kinds of things.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:12
counties, like I said earlier, tend to be larger jurisdictions, wherein municipalities reside.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:18
And they tend to provide more regional assets.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:21
Airports, seaports.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:23
libraries, mass transit, those kinds of things.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:26
Right, because there's a benefit to the entire region.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:30
whether you live in Homestead or Aventura, we all benefit from Miami International Airport. There's one airport.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:36
In Miami-Dade County, right? And whether you live in Homestead or Aventura, you can go to MIA and take a flight wherever you want to go.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:43
The library system. It benefits everybody in the entire county, whether you live in Homestead, or Aventura, or Miami Lakes, or Key Biscayne.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:50
Right? Mass transit. I can hop on a bus in Miami Lakes, and it'll take me to Miami Beach.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:10:57
It may take a while, but I know that there is a connection that will happen to allow me to do that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:02
Right? Alright, so counties focus on regional services,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:06
municipalities tend to focus on more specific

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:09
municipal-type things, like police, fire, garbage pickup, parks, road maintenance, those kinds of things.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:16
All right, the third bullet here is school districts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:20
School districts are also a form of a local government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:24
Right? Because they, um, provide a very specific service to a very specific area.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:31
Right? The job of the school district is basically to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:36
Um, you know, run the educational system from K

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:40
to 12th grade. Um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:42
And, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:44
you know, that's their responsibility, and it's different than the work

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:49
of the cities, and it's different than the work of the counties.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:52
People tend to get confused, you know, Miami-Dade County Public Schools with Miami-Dade County.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:58
Because the names are the same, basically.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:11:59
But the work of Miami-Dade County is to run regional assets such as the airport, the libraries, and mass transit,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:07
Versus the mission and work of the Miami-Dade County Public School System,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:10
Which is to run the public schools that happen to reside in Miami-Dade County.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:15
Okay. Regardless,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:18
All of these types of local governments, municipalities, counties, school districts, even special taxing districts,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:23
They all have the same structure that we've talked about before, right? They all have a legislative branch,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:29
an executive branch, and a judicial branch.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:30
So let's take a look. Let's start with cities.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:33
We use the City of Miami as, um, our model here, since it's the largest one in Miami-Dade County.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:39
City of Miami has 3 branches of government. The legislative branch includes their mayor and city commission. I put council there, but it's actually the commission.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:48
were elected by the people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:50
And their job, primarily, is to pass laws

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:52
Only for the people that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:55
reside or visit

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:12:57
within the City of Miami. All right, the City of Miami can pass a law tomorrow that says, hey, you can't

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:03
Um, you know, paint your house purple.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:06
In the city of Miami. Okay, well…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:10
Hialeah doesn't have anything like that, so if you want to paint your house purple, great, you can do it in Hialeah, but in the city of Miami, they picked

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:15
passed a law that said you can't paint your house purple.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:18
Right? Something like that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:20
The executive branch in municipal governments, um, are really run by its unique

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:25
and different than the state and federal government, because at those two levels,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:29
they're an elected person, right? At the state level, it's the governor, at the federal level, it's the president.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:35
The municipal level, um, it tends to be a city manager, like, in my case, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:40
City managers are appointed

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:43
by the legislative branch to act as the CEO, to run the services provided by the city.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:49
Alright, and city managers are then responsible for running, you know, the police department and the fire department, and the sanitation department.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:54
And the Public Works Department, and the Parks Department, and the Building Department, Code Compliance, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:13:59
All of those areas that, you know, make up

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:03
function of a municipal government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:06
And then you have, um, even at the city level, you've got, um, what are called municipal courts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:11
you know, you get a municipal fine, like,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:13
You painted your house purple, and there's a provision that says you can't. They got a fine by the city,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:18
And you have to go to court, and if you're guilty, you pay the fine, and then you have to fix it, right? Because it's against the law in Miami.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:25
To paint your house purple. So there are municipal courts that exist.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:30
Versus, let's look at the county.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:32
We know that counties are larger in nature, right? Because municipalities reside within a county.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:37
Um, they're… they're more regional in nature, but they too have 3 branches of government, legislative, executive, and judicial.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:46
Their legislative branch is, um, in this case, it's the Board of Miami-Dade County Commissioners.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:52
Their job is to pass laws that apply to Miami-Dade County.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:56
Right, for the most part, they govern

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:14:58
you know, issues at the airport, the seaport, the performing arts center, the library system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:03
there's a county police department, right? The sheriff's department.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:07
Um, elections, you know, all those very…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:11
broad areas that impact everybody in the entire county.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:16
There's an executive branch at the county. In our case, in Miami-Dade County, the executive branch is headed up by

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:23
an elected mayor, so the mayor of Miami-Dade County, I think it was one of the questions that I asked you, who that person is.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:29
Hopefully you know her name.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:31
Um, so she acts as the CEO for Miami-Dade County.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:35
And then, of course, there's the judicial component at the county level as well, which is the county courts. You know, you get a traffic ticket or a driving ticket or something of that nature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:44
Well, you're going to go to a county court and, um, you know, hopefully it'll get resolved in a positive way for you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:50
Alright, Miami-Dade County Public Schools.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:15:53
They, too, have 3 branches of government, legislative, executive, and judicial, right? The legislative branch at the school district, it's the school board. If any of you went to a public school, Miami-Dade County, you may be familiar with who your school board member is. There are 9 of them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:08
you know, elected by districts. There are 9 districts in the Miami-Dade County public school system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:13
You elect a school board member, and they act as the legislative body. They are the ones that…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:18
you know, make the laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:21
For any kid that's in school from pre-K to 12th grade. You know, all those policies and all of those things that…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:27
are policy-oriented in any way,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:30
come from the Miami-Dade County Public School Board.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:33
The executive branch at the school level is headed up by the superintendent of schools. Again, if you went to a school in Miami-Dade County, you're probably familiar. The current school board.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:43
Our superintendent is Jose Dortress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:45
The one previous to him, which many of you probably were in school at the time, is Alberto Carvalho.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:51
Who now is the superintendent of schools in Los Angeles County.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:16:55
And then finally, you have a judicial component as well in the school systems. Um, they work

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:01
In partnership with the county courts, it's typically the juvenile courts, right? So if you're underage or a minor,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:06
And you're accused of a crime, you will be routed through the juvenile court system, um, which is a partner of the Miami-Dade County

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:14
court system, right? And they, uh, they work in tandem with that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:19
All right, so those are the three main types of local governments, right? So you got municipalities,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:25
City of Miami, Town of Miami Lakes,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:28
Village of Key Biscayne, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:30
counties, Miami-Dade, Broward, Monroe, Orange, Leon,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:35
Um, and school districts, you know, every county has its own school district.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:39
So you… it's easy to see why there are over 100,000 of them in the United States, because if you add up all the cities,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:46
all the counties and all the school districts, you know, per state, then you're gonna exceed that $100,000.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:53
All right, let's talk a little bit about, and we'll start wrapping up.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:17:57
How do governments at each of the three levels, federal, state, and local,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:02
get their money. They get it through taxes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:05
Taxes are super unpopular, you know, we call them a necessary evil.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:10
They are defined in the, uh, Constitution, right? The U.S. Constitution defines the income tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:17
And then the state and local constitutions define the, um, sales and

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:22
State income tax and property taxes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:24
Um, so they're a necessary evil, right? Because you get what you pay for, and in order for those services to be delivered by governments,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:31
at the federal, state, and local level, you know, you need money to be able to do that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:35
If you want your… the City of Hialeah safe,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:38
And you want police officers to be patrolling, you gotta pay police officers, and you gotta find money in order to do that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:44
Same thing with firefighters and people that collect the garbage, and people that run the parks, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:49
schoolteachers, you know, if you're a public school teacher,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:52
You work for a local government, Miami-Dade County Public Schools.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:55
So you need money to do all of the things that governments do at each level.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:18:59
Federal government, in order for them to provide their services, the main source of revenue that they get is from income tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:07
Right? So if you work legally in this country, you're going to pay income tax to the federal government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:13
The IRS collects that money,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:16
The money is allotted to the federal government in order for them to be able to provide all the services that they do.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:21
Right, running the military and United States Postal Service, and the national parks, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:26
All of those things that the Feds do for us.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:30
The states get their money in one of two ways, or a combination of the two ways, right? It's either through sales tax,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:37
and or state income tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:39
Right, some states only have a sales tax, like the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:43
Some states, um, only have a state income tax, some states have both.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:49
So here in Florida, we don't have a state income tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:52
It's what makes us such a popular destination for many people. It's why we've seen such a huge population growth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:19:57
Over the last couple of decades, right? Because people want to come to a state,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:01
Where they're not having to pay federal income tax to the federal government, and then state income tax to their state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:06
Right? There's some states where

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:09
they have a state income tax, right? New York is a good example, right? So New York, not only do you pay an income tax to the federal government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:16
In addition, you pay an income tax to the state of New York.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:20
So, if you make $100,000 in New York City,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:24
Right? A portion of that's gonna go to the federal government, you know, approximately 20-something percent.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:31
Then another portion of that, approximately 20-something percent, can go to the state of New York.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:36
So that $100,000 after taxes is closer to $60,000.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:41
Versus if you make $100,000 in Miami, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:45
You pay income tax, about 20-something percent, right? So about $20,000 will go to the feds.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:50
But you don't pay income tax to the state of Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:54
So, the $100,000 salary in New York City, after taxes, is about $60,000.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:20:59
$100,000 salary in Miami after taxes is about $80,000.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:03
Right? So again…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:06
is one of six states that doesn't have

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:08
a state income tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:09
So those, not surprisingly, those 6 states have become very popular in the last, you know, certainly since the pandemic, but even before

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:16
or as places to come, because you get

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:19
You pay less in taxes, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:21
So here in Florida,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:23
the way the state of Florida gets their revenue is through sales tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:27
Right? You go buy something, and you pay a tax, and that tax goes to the state,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:32
And that's the money that the state of Florida uses in order for them to provide their services.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:37
Alright, so you go to Macy's tomorrow after class,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:40
You buy a shirt for $10,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:42
The state income tax, I'm sorry, the state sales tax in the state of Florida is 7 cents, so for every dollar you spend,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:48
You spend 7 cents in sales tax, and that money goes then.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:52
That is, uh, the bulk of it is what's…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:54
used to fund the state of Florida, okay?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:21:57
Um, there's other revenue sources, by the way, you know, like, for example, the state of Florida, one of the main reasons we were able to avoid state income taxes is because Florida was a pioneer in tolling system.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:08
On the roads, right? We were really one of the first states to put tolls. We had so many tourists that were coming.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:14
that they decided, hey, let's put these tools, you know, people going, driving through different interstates have to pay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:20
Right? And we're gonna get a lot of money from tourists, because we get so many tourists that come to Florida.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:24
So the state, you know, derives

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:27
a lot of money from all of the tolls. You know, it's almost like there's a toll everywhere now. You know, certainly on every major interstate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:35
Um, the Turnpike and, you know, the Palmetto, and the 836, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:40
All of those roads are considered either county or state roads have tolls in place. We pay for it to use those roads.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:46
And that money collected, uh, goes to the state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:49
To be able to fund improvements, um, to those roads.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:22:54
Okay? Alright, and then lastly, local governments. So your municipalities, your counties, your school boards.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:02
They get their money from property taxes. So if you own property, whether it's residential, like a home or commercial, like a business,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:09
You're going to pay a tax on the value of the market value of that property.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:15
And that money goes to the various local governments that provide services to you. So let's say you live in the city of Hialeah,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:22
I have a house in Hialeah, right, so I pay property taxes

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:26
based on the value of that home,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:28
And that money then gets divided basically into three.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:32
Right, a third of the property taxes that I would pay for that home goes to the city of Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:36
And Hialeah then uses that money to pay for police and fire and garbage pickup in parks and code and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:42
all of the things that Hialeah provides the residents that live in the city of Hialeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:47
A third of that money collected from my property taxes from that home in Hialeah,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:51
go to Miami-Dade County, and Miami-Dade County uses that money to pay for the things they do.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:23:56
Mass transit, libraries, Miami International Airport, the Seaport, the Performing Arts Center.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:02
All of those regional assets that they're responsible for.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:05
And then the remaining third goes to the Miami-Dade County Public Schools.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:09
and NDCPS then uses that money to run the school system in Miami-Dade County.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:14
Right? So property taxes, um, you know, here in Miami-Dade County are divided approximately into three.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:21
local governments that support you, your city that you live in, the county, and then the Miami-Dade County Public Schools.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:27
Right, and that's how those three local governments

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:30
get their money to be able to… Miami-Dade County Public School, pay for all the teachers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:34
do all the maintenance on the buildings, you know, pay for the books and all that other stuff that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:40
are important for schools. That's how Miami-Dade County gets their money to run all of the things they run, and that's how the cities, in the case of the example I provided, the city of Hialeah,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:49
uses, um, or collects their money to run all the services that they're responsible for.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:24:55
So again, governments are funded by a series of taxes for the most part, even though they may have other revenue sources.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:02
At the federal level, it's an income tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:04
at the state level, it's either and or a combination of sales tax and or state income tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:11
And then at the local level, it's property taxes for both residential and commercial properties.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:17
Okay, that is my last slide, I believe.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:20
It is, so I'm gonna stop there and open it up to any questions that anybody may have.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:27
on any of the items that we've talked about.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:33
Alright, any questions on any of the people that you're having?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:37
a hard time finding.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:42
No? Everybody got it? I guess I… when I went through my lecture then,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:48
You, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:50
I had answered some of those questions?

[Merline Fenelon] 20:25:52
Yes, sir. For me, for me, so far.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:54
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:25:57
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:26:00
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:26:03
All right, let me do this, then, as you guys are thinking about questions, let me work on our role.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:26:08
attendance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:26:11
So this is an updated sheet, so hopefully it's up to date after the drop ad. So, Andrea Costa.

And Jocelyn. All right, anybody here that I did not call their name?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:31:33
Alright, I got a good list then.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:31:36
Alright guys, so… alright, so you've done your homework assignment that I would have otherwise…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:31:42
given you, given you. So, um, question for you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:31:46
Anybody here, I haven't heard from anybody, so I just want to make sure, anybody who has access to the Shark Pack, have you been able to access it?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:31:55
Anybody not?

[Merline Fenelon] 20:31:57
I haven't.

[Alejandro Lorenzo] 20:31:58
Good enough.

[Abiel Pedre] 20:31:58
No, I haven't been able to get to it.

[Sean Burke] 20:32:00
The book?

[Melaya Sippio] 20:32:01
I still can't do the book.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:02
You got the book instead? Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:04
All right, I… I…

[Alejandro Lorenzo] 20:32:05
I got the book too, because I couldn't either to access the Sharp app.

[Merline Fenelon] 20:32:06
Oh…

[Alejandro Lorenzo] 20:32:09
I don't know. Yes, uh, that edition is old. Right now, they are on edition 15.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:10
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:15
Oh, okay.

[Alejandro Lorenzo] 20:32:17
Or not so long.

[Merline Fenelon] 20:32:18
It wouldn't let me, so I had to just order it on Amazon.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:20
Yeah, okay. Alright, listen, if you can get the book, then just…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:24
get the book. So, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:26
But yeah, so the homework then for next week, guys, is to… what we're gonna do next week is we're gonna do some of that history on, um, you know, the key

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:37
milestones that led to the eventual Declaration of Independence, and then the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:41
the ratification of the Constitution. So basically, we're heading into Chapter 1.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:44
So if you can try to get the book by then, you know, that's your homework, is to read Chapter 1. Jessica.

[Angel Lamas] 20:32:47
Okay.

[Jessica Mursuli] 20:32:50
No, I just wanted to let you know, I turned in my homework, but I sent… just the PDF that you sent.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:56
Yeah.

[Jessica Mursuli] 20:32:57
Blank without the answers, like a big dummy. And then I re-sense it when class started, I realized that…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:32:58
That's okay. Yeah, re…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:02
Okay, no worries.

[Jessica Mursuli] 20:33:03
The second email is my homework. Done. Thank you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:05
Okay, perfect. Yeah, and remember, guys, the homework, I don't grade, so if you do it, you get the credit for it, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:11
Your written assignments, which you've not had any yet, your written assignments…

[Sean Burke] 20:33:14
So here in San Francisco.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:16
will, uh, will be graded. So, um, you know, just that one homework, and then homework for next week is to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:22
Um, just start with Chapter 1.

[Abiel Pedre] 20:33:23
Questions, are they winning assignment gonna be posting on Canvas?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:29
Yes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:31
Yeah. All right, so I will post that tonight, too, to make sure to remind everybody that, uh, you know, for next week, we're just, uh, on starting Chapter 1.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:39
And then I'll tweak… I'll tweak the syllabus, just…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:42
I had a class period where we were going to do some… something, and I'm just gonna not do it, so don't worry. We're just basically one week behind, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:51
So, on your syllabus, which is a good point,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:33:54
We were supposed to be having a test next week, but you're not, right? So I will send out an email, I'll put it on Canvas to clarify that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:34:00
you know, next week we're doing, basically, Chapter 1, the history portion of our course.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:34:05
And then your test will be the following week, I believe, right? So don't stress too much about it. We'll have some…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:34:10
Flexibility in class, and we'll make up for everything, and uh…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:34:15
you know, you won't miss anything, don't worry.

[Sean Burke] 20:34:19
Um, just… since you asked about it, right? I am able to access the book.

[Sean Burke] 20:34:25
But I'm clicking through it right now. Yeah, but it only gave…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:34:27
The Shark Pack?

[Sean Burke] 20:34:31
I don't know if this is the same for everyone who got to access it.

[Sean Burke] 20:34:35
It only gives us up to Chapter 3, so I guess I gotta purchase the book.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:34:42
Okay.

[Sean Burke] 20:34:43
Like, every… after chapter 3, it says, um…

[Merline Fenelon] 20:34:53
Question regarding…

[Sean Burke] 20:34:54
This section is not available with demo mode.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:34:59
Okay.

[Sean Burke] 20:35:01
So…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:35:01
You know, listen, I'm not too familiar with the Shark Pack, that's more of a… at least in this course, anyway.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:35:07
I know I asked my chair about it, and he sent me that link that I shared with all of you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:35:13
Let me… I'll reach back out to them and say that it appears that people are having issues, just to see if there's anything he can, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:35:21
He can, you know, help me

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:35:24
pass on to you guys, so that you guys can, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:35:27
be able to better connect with it.

[Sean Burke] 20:35:30
Okay.

[Merline Fenelon] 20:35:31
Question regarding a purchase. Um.

[Merline Fenelon] 20:35:35
With financial aid, it comes with a book, so how come it's, like, giving us… it gives me a hard time to get into the book when it also covers class and the book.

[Abiel Pedre] 20:35:44
Actually, sometimes it happens like that, so what is… what you guys are gonna do, that's what it is, so you're gonna have to get back to them.

[Abiel Pedre] 20:35:51
With it so that we can fix the leg. So the leg is the issue, so they're gonna give him the one that got everything on it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:35:57
And who does that? ABL?

[Abiel Pedre] 20:36:00
Uh, the people that do the book, that give you the link, they are the same people that are gonna fix it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:04
But how did… who does she go to? Like, did she go to the bookstore, or how does she… who…

[Abiel Pedre] 20:36:08
No, you contact them, the one that give you the link. So you tell them we have an issue with it, they will fix it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:13
And I'm sorry, I'm still not clear who's they.

[Merline Fenelon] 20:36:16
Exactly, because I'm kind of lost.

[Abiel Pedre] 20:36:18
We'll give you the link to give us. Whoever gives you that leg.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:21
Oh, got it, the chair. Okay, so the length of the chair provides. Understood. Okay, all right, cool. All right, let me… I will email my professor…

[Abiel Pedre] 20:36:23
Got to thinking. Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:29
As soon as we adjourn class,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:31
And I'll… not my professor, my chair, and ask him for more guidance then.

[Merline Fenelon] 20:36:36
Okay, thank you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:37
Yeah, and listen, guys, if you can't get the book by next week, I mean, you know, the text is only gonna help you with the material that we cover.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:44
But I do a pretty thorough

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:46
lecture, you know, on the key points that I want you to have. I will share a PowerPoint with you beforehand, so you'll be able to follow the PowerPoint, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:53
You know, the text only adds information that I cover,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:36:57
But the reality is, you know, what I test you on is basically gonna come from the material that I share with you on the PowerPoint.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:37:05
Um, so, okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:37:07
All right, Alejandro just posted something, so hopefully that helps some of you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:37:12
Sorry, I'm old school. Remember, when I was your age, there was no internet, there was no social media, you know, I basically had a dot matrix printer, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:37:19
you know, I'm pretty old school when it comes to the technology, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:37:23
Hopefully, I can get the answers for you and, um, and it'll help you guys connect with what you need.

[Merline Fenelon] 20:37:30
Okay, thank you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 20:37:31
Alrighty, guys.
