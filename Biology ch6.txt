[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:26
a plant cell, um, going into the chloroplast and the absorbing

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:31
um… pigment and things like that. So, I'm gonna go through it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:36
Um, kind of in a list, and then I'm going to show you it visually on the next slide, but I definitely recommend you guys take notes on this slide. Once we get into the photosynthetic process.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:45
Um, I'm gonna make you know, you know, where things are happening in the cell, so you have to know

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:51
parts of the chloroplast and things like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:53
So, first off, we have the mesophyll cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:56
Which is basically the leaf.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:59
Or the, um, excuse me, the plant cell, right? It's a plant cell. And this is where reactions and photosynthesis happen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:05
deep within, uh, the chloroplast in the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:10
So, then we have the chloroplasts. These are the organelles, okay? These are the organelles that are carrying out photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:18
They are the ones responsible for this, and we're going to talk more about them later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:24
Um, within the chloroplasts, we have the stroma,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:28
Which is basically, like, the fluid

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:32
inside. And you can equate this to… do you guys remember the cytoplasm?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:37
From a eukaryotic cell? Remember how we went through the whole cell back in Chapter 4?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:43
Um, the cytoplasm was, like, the jelly, fluid-like substance that's surrounding the organelles in a cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:51
The stroma is similar. It is the fluid inside the chloroplast holding all of the

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:57
thylakoids together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:59
The thylakoids, um, it's a funny word I know, try saying that on your own, thylakoids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:06
They are the sacks within a chloroplast that are green.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:11
Um, because they have a special pigment, which we'll talk about in just a second, but this is where, um, a lot of the photosynthetic process happens.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:19
So, we have the cell, we have the chloroplast. Within the chloroplast, we have the fluid,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:25
Which is the stroma, and we have the thylakoid, which are the sacs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:29
A stack of those sacks are called grana, okay? Honestly, thylakoids look more like pancakes. I call them, like, green pancakes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:38
So, a thylakoid is a single green pancake, and a grano is a stack of green pancakes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:45
Okay, a stack of thylakoids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:48
And finally, we have chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the pigment that is within that bilakoid membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:55
Oops, sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:58
Um, the thylakoid, that green pancake, right? It has… it's green, and it has a, um, a kind of membrane… a membrane around it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:07
Um, and that is where the chlorophyll lives.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:12
So the chlorophyll is a special pigment that helps to absorb the solar energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:18
within, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:22
the… the chloroplast.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:24
Okay? I'll give you guys a second on this slide, make sure that you know all of these guys, especially the thylakoid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:31
The stroma and the chloroplast.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:41
I'm sorry if you hear my cat in the background.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:45
He wants to eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:56
Okay, so now let's look at this visually.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:00
So here, we have, on the top right, we have a leaf.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:04
This is just a normal leaf, and if you were to take a cross-section of this leaf, so basically think of it like a sheet of paper, and you're gonna cut it

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:14
In half, right? With scissors.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:17
The thin part of the leaf

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:18
like, the… when you were to cut it, that little cross-section…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:23
that is what this guy is right here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:26
this big, blown-up cube here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:29
So, if you look… if you can imagine it, this is the top of the leaf.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:33
And this is the bottom side of the leaf.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:37
So, here we have a bunch of mesophyll cells. So these are these, like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:43
you know, angular, square, mesophyll cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:47
And this is what it looks like a real mesophyll cell looks like within, uh, under a microscope.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:54
Okay, so this is kind of a depiction of it, and this is what it actually looks like.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:58
in a special microscope called an SEM microscope.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:02
Um, basically… basically lets you see 3D items really, really small.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:07
But in good detail. So here's a mesophyll cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:11
And here we have these little sacks in here. Those are… I don't want to say sacks, I don't… I don't want to confuse you with the thylakoid, but these little, like, beans here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:21
And each one of these beans are chloroplast.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:24
Okay, so here's the chloroplast.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:27
It's this, um, bean-shaped thing here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:30
So, inside the chloroplast, we have the stroma, which is the space, right? The space around

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:37
The thylakoids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:38
Each of these greed…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:42
Excuse me. Each of these green pancakes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:47
are a thylakoid. And if you look at a stack of thylakoids, they are called a grana.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:52
But don't worry about Grana so much, it's just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:55
vocab. But I do want you to know this is a chloroplast, and you have the stroma, which is the space in between the thylakoids, the grain pancakes, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:06
And someone took a real, uh, chloroplast from a leaf,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:10
We're a plant, and they, um, put it on a microscope slide and blew it up 23,000 magnification. So this is what it actually looks like. They're very, very small.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:22
Okay, so hopefully that is a good visual for you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:26
Um, so looking at the photosynthetic process in terms of the chemical reactions that happened,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:33
that happen at the very basis… basic level, water…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:38
And carbon dioxide is turned into carbohydrate and oxygen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:44
Please make sure you know this equation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:47
Um, for photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:50
This… what I just read to you, water and carbon dioxide, is turned into carbohydrate and oxygen,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:56
is the, um, kind of sentence version of this down here. So this is the chemical equation for photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:04
So, we have solar energy coming in,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:07
Um, but we have water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:09
H2O, and carbon dioxide, CO2,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:14
That is going to yield… I don't know if you guys remember that, I forgot if I taught that in the beginning, but this arrow in a chemical reaction means yields, okay? So water and carbon dioxide yields

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:28
this, uh, carbohydrate, which is glucose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:31
And oxygen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:34
Okay? So, in chemical reactions, there is a reactant, or there are reactants, and there are products.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:42
Someone tell me, which sets of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:46
Molecules are the reactants. The one at the beginning or the one at the end?

[Antonella Diaz] 17:53:52
Beginning?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:53
At the beginning, yeah. So, H2O and CO2, those are the reactants. They're going to be reacting together with the solar energy,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:01
going through the process of photosynthesis until they produce these products, glucose and oxygen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:09
Okay? You can think about it like plants are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:12
absorbing carbon dioxide from the air, right? And they are releasing oxygen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:18
We know that happened. So this is where it comes from in the chemical equation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:23
Um, it also creates glucose, which is basically making food for itself.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:28
And we know that we have to water plants, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:31
So, watering plants, they take that water, they take the carbon dioxide from the air,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:36
And they're able to make glucose to feed themselves, right, because plants don't eat, they just need water and sun.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:43
And then they can produce oxygen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:47
So hopefully that makes it clear for you guys. We're going to talk about these reduction and oxidation things in just a little bit, but for now, just know…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:57
this equation, so make sure everybody writes it down.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:02
And we'll come back to this in a couple slides, so you have another chance to write it down.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:15
But photosynthesis is an example of a redox reaction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:20
Okay? Redox reactions involve reduction and oxidation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:25
So, reduction is when a molecule gains electrons and hydrogen ions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:31
in the molecule is being reduced.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:35
Okay, so reduction, um, I know it sounds counterintuitive, you think of

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:40
you know, lowering a number of something, but I want you to think the opposite for this. So,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:47
We, in reduction, we are adding or gaining electron and hydrogen ions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:52
Um… hydrogen ions…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:55
It's just basically, like, the letter H in the chemical reactions, and I'll show you that in just a second.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:00
Yeah, Brandon, you have a question?

[Brandon Montejo] 17:56:03
Yeah, you said, uh, redox reactions involve reduction, and what else? I'm sorry, I didn't catch that last part.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:09
know you're fine. Oxidation, I'm gonna tell you right now about it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:12
So, that's okay.

[Brandon Montejo] 17:56:12
Oh, okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:14
Who's getting ahead of me? It's awesome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:16
Um, so oxidation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:19
Um, this is the next one. So this is the opposite of reduction. This is when molecules

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:24
lose electrons and hydrogen ions. And they say the molecule is being oxidized.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:30
So, oxidation, you are losing that hydrogen ion from the chemical equation, and I'll show you what this looks like in photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:40
But the term redox, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:44
occur, or happen, or…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:46
The term redox comes from both of the types of reactions that occur there. Reduction in oxidation. So the re or redo…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:53
the re part of, uh, redox is reduction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:57
And the aux is for oxidation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:00
And these two always occur together. There has to be one… it's like a balancing act, right? There has to be one that is taking away some hydrogens, and there has to be one that's adding some hydrogens. There's not going to be just a reduction reaction or just an oxidation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:15
Um, they have to occur together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:19
So the best way you guys can remember this is a little acronym called OIL RIG.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:25
like an oil rig, right, offshore, where they pump oil out of the ground.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:30
Um, underneath the ocean. So, oil rig. O-I-L stands for oxidation is loss.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:38
So, oxidation is lost.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:41
Oxidation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:44
Excuse me, one molecules

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:47
are losing electrons and hydrogen ions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:52
oxidation is loss, okay? We're losing hydrogen ions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:56
That's the main thing you can think of. It is electrons, but for the purposes of this class, just remember the hydrogen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:02
And then RIG, R-I-G, reduction, is gain. So, reduction is gaining molecules, or excuse me, electrons and hydrogen ions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:13
It is gaining the hydrogen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:15
Okay, we'll give you a second, make sure you write this down in your notes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:19
And I'll show you how this looks like in photosynthesis next.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:20
Okay. So now we'll look at this, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:24
in terms of photosynthesis, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:27
Here we have the photosynthetic equation that we just looked at before.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:33
H2O plus CO2 yields glucose and oxygen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:39
So, here we're going to see which are being reduced and which are being oxidized.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:44
So if we look over here, let's start with water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:47
We have H2O, that's water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:49
And H2O,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:52
As it shows here, is going to be oxidized to oxygen, or O2.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:58
So, if we remember, oxidation is loss. We are losing a hydrogen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:03
So does everyone see how here we have H2O,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:07
And over here, we have O2.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:10
The hydrogen has been removed.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:13
So it means that the water molecule has been oxidized.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:18
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:21
The opposite is reduction, and here we're going to see CO2 being reduced to glucose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:28
So, carbon dioxide, CO2, is being reduced to CH2O.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:35
This is glucose. So you guys see how there's a C, there's an O, and here an H got added.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:41
Specifically to ages.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:44
Okay? So when you're adding an H into the equation, or into the molecule,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:51
You're being reduced, and if it's being taken away, you're being oxidized.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:58
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:01
So that is a redox reaction for photosynthesis. The next chapter, 7, we're going to look at cellular respiration, which is just the opposite, but it is also a redox reaction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:13
So we have two sets of reactions in photosynthesis, um, where the term photosynthesis comes from.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:19
The photo part refers to the light reactions, which in this figure is over here, looking at these green thylakoids right here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:27
And then the synthesis part is synthesizing a carbohydrate, or making, or creating a carbohydrate, which is the glucose, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:36
And this happens in the Calvin cycle reactions, which is this purple…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:41
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:43
cycle here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:46
Um, everybody take note, I'm gonna show this, uh, image at the end again, a little bit bigger, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:53
Um, put a little star next to this slide, um, this image is something you're gonna have to memorize.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:01
And I know it looks a little confusing when you first look at it, or a little complex,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:05
But once you, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:09
Once I explain it, you're gonna see it's not too bad. But I make my students memorize this because it… because it's a perfect…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:16
Um, summary explanation of photosynthesis and all of the things that go into each, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:24
reaction and what comes out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:25
So, here, this big ol' green thing, or this…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:29
I guess clear thing with green things inside, is the chloroplast, okay? Again, we're inside the mesophyll cell, we're in a plant cell, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:38
And it's green because we have these thylakoids that are green with chlorophyll inside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:45
And then the space around it is the stroma. So, the Calvin cycle, you can see, happens in the stroma.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:52
Okay, so let's look at the left side first. So we have solar energy,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:55
Coming into these light reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:58
Okay? We also have water coming into the light reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:02
And from the Calvin Cycle, because it's kind of… photosynthesis is like a cycle,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:08
Um, the products…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:10
of the Calvin Cycle, some of the products are ADP plus P.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:15
Which, from we learned last chapter, are the components to make up ATP, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:21
That phosphate group just has to attach to that ADP, and it will become

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:27
ATP. So here, this goes into the light reactions, and so does this new character, NADP+.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:35
Don't be confused by all the letters, just know that it is another energy electron

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:40
molecule, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:42
another energy molecule, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:45
So all of these guys go into the light reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:49
And what comes out? We have oxygen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:52
And then we have NADPH, which is the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:57
If we're adding a hydrogen,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:00
reduction is gain. We are reducing NADP+,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:04
And it is becoming NADPH.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:07
If you can see the kind of color differences, how these on the top are kind of just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:13
bland, and then when they come out of the light reactions, they're all colorful and energized, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:18
So these are the high-energy electrons, the NADPH and the ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:24
So those come out of the light reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:27
And… that's it. So then, we have the Calvin Cycle reactions, the second part, the synthesis part of photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:36
what goes in. We have carbon dioxide going in,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:40
And we have the NADPH and the ATP, those high-energy electrons,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:45
going into the Calvin Cycle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:48
So those three things go in, and what do we have that comes out?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:51
the carbohydrate glucose, CH2O.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:55
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:57
So, I know it looks confusing, but if you walk through it just like I did, and you look at every single part,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:04
Um, you can, you know…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:06
pretty much understand it. I definitely recommend that you guys draw this in your notes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:12
Um, drawing things visually and putting, like I said, um, pencil to paper, or pen to paper.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:17
is really helpful. You can use colored pencils to make it, you know, pretty. You can just do different colored pens, or just a pencil if you want.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:25
But I recommend you write it in your notes, because it'll help you memorize it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:29
better. So for the exam, um, I will be blocking out some of these words, so I might block out Calvin Cycle reactions, and you'll have to tell me what that is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:41
I might block out oxygen,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:43
I might block out ATP or ADP plus P.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:47
I could block out anything from here. Stroma, thylakoid membrane…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:51
I could block out anything, and that will be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:54
a couple questions on your exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:57
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:59
So, just FYI.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:03
Okay. Now we're gonna basically do a quick summary of both of these cycles. We'll get into more details in it a little bit later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:12
But, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:17
I'm not gonna make you base… I'm not gonna make you memorize all of the nitty-gritty details of photosynthesis. That's why I say…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:26
this figure is the best, because it tells you everything that goes in, everything that comes out,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:31
how they're being used, where they're… where they're, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:35
you know, located where the reactions are happening.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:38
So, I do this so that way you guys don't have to remember all of the nitty-gritty details that I'm gonna tell you later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:44
But… excuse me. But, I do want to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:49
give you this summary slide for the light reactions and the Calvin cycle reactions, so please pay attention to this slide, take notes on this slide, write down whatever you can.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:58
And then the later sections, I'll let you know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:01
Um, when I can kind of just breeze through it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:04
So the light reactions happen in the thylakoid membrane. We saw that in the image, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:13
Light reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane. This makes sense…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:18
Because someone tell me, what color is the thylakoid?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:07:24
Green?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:26
green. And why is it green? What does it have?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:07:33
A chloroplast?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:34
It has a chlorophyll, the chlorophyll.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:38
Yeah, it's all within the chloroplast.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:41
Um, but when you think chloro, you can think green.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:45
But anyway, chlorophyll.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:47
So the chlorophyll is absorbing the solar energy and energizing the electrons, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:53
the sun, the solar, um, energy that's going into the thylakoid membrane that's being absorbed by the chloroform,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:01
is energizing electrons, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:06
Water is then gonna be oxidized.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:10
Water is then gonna be oxidized, I'll show you that later, and ATP

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:17
is produced from ADP plus that phosphate group in something called the electron transport chain. I'll tell you about that later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:26
But remember, ADP plus the phosphate group

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:31
If you combine them and put the phosphate group back onto ADP,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:37
You get ATP that is produced, and that is the energy

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:44
Electron.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:45
of… sorry, the energy molecule of cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:50
Okay? And then lastly, this new character we have, NADP+, which is just another energy electron, or energy molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:59
is reduced. Um, like I said, it accepts electrons or accepts the hydrogen, and it becomes NADPH.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:07
Okay, again, another high-energy

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:10
molecule that can work with ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:12
to go into the Calvin Cycle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:16
So the Calvin Cycle reactions happen in the stroma, like I mentioned before, and like we saw in the figure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:22
It occurs in the stroma.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:24
So that's the space within the thi… um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:29
Sorry, the space within the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:31
chloroplast.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:34
carbon dioxide is going to be taken up by one of the molecules, I'll show you that in just a little bit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:39
And then the ATP and the NADPH…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:43
That were produced from the light reactions are going to reduce that carbon dioxide into the carbohydrate of glucose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:52
So, carbon dioxide…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:54
In order to turn that, to reduce it into gluc… or, yeah, into glucose, we need energy to do that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:01
Okay, so we need ATP and NADPH.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:06
Oops. Okay, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:10
That is a good summary of everything. Um, this is basically everything that you see in the previous slide in that image, that figure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:19
And that's what I want you guys to remember.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:23
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:27
That's what I want you guys to always remember.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:30
Okay. Now, let's see what time it is… 610. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:35
I'm gonna go through the light reactions a little bit quicker, and the Calvin Cycle reactions a little bit quicker.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:42
Again, I showed you the most important parts, but now I'm going to go through the nitty-gritty of how it happens, and then I'll show you images to help you, kind of,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:51
Um, conceptualize it. But…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:54
Let's look at the left side, the light reactions, the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:59
a photo part of photosynthesi… of photosynthesis that is harvesting the energy from the sun.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:05
So, there's two main photosynthesizing cells. We have chlorophyll, and we have carotenoids. Carotenoids are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:14
Think about carrots and red peppers and, like, brightly colored things like that, like the oranges, that kind of family.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:20
they have carotenoids, um, and these are both things that absorb visible light, but

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:26
For the purposes of our class, just know chlorophyll is the main one. That's why a lot of plants are green.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:31
Right? Of course, there's other, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:34
plants that are different colors, and they can still absorb

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:37
the sun, um, the sun's rays, but chlorophyll is the dominant one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:44
So within the light reactions, I took, like, a little screenshot of this, so you can see the left side of the figure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:51
Um, basically what happens is

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:55
This light reaction area is able to capture the sun's energy,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:00
And it can store it as a hydrogen ion gradient, so an H plus gradient.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:06
It can… basically, it's like a bank. It holds and stores the hydrogen ions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:12
There are two different systems within the light reactions called Photosystem 1 and Photosystem 2.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:19
Photosystem 2 occurs first.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:21
And Photosystem 1 happened second. Um, I wish they just renamed it, but they were named in order by which they were discovered.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:28
So, photosystem.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:32
One…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:33
that little light harvesting center, Photosystem 1, was discovered first.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:38
But it does happen second, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:41
They should have just renamed it to Save Everyone a headache, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:45
you know, that's science sometimes. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:49
Anyway, Photosystem 1 and Photosystem 2 are the light harvesting, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:55
areas within the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:57
light reactions here in the thylakoid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:03
Um, think about it. Photo system. Photo is light. It's a system that's absorbing light.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:08
Okay, photo system.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:11
So, these are abbreviated as PS1 and PS2.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:15
Um, not like PlayStation, but, like, photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:18
So, Photosystem 1 and Photosystem 2 are going to receive those photons,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:24
Um, photons are those, um, beams from the sun, right? Those energy, kind of like electric…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:30
molecules. They're very, uh, energized.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:35
Um, so both of these are a pigment complex, or that light harvesting

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:41
center, or that system that I just told you about, um, and it's able to accept electrons.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:46
Okay? Think about it like an antenna…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:49
for gathering solar energy. So Photosystem 1 and Photosystem 2 are like antennas to gather energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:57
Next, what happens is Photosystem 2, it's gonna split the water. So water, we know, goes into the light reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:06
And the electrons become really excited because of that solar energy, and they are going to move to the electron receptor molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:14
Electrons are removed from the water, releasing the oxygen into

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:20
hydrogen ions. So this is how oxygen is released from the light system, the light reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:27
So, basically, Photosystem 2 breaks up the water, so it becomes hydrogen molecules and oxygen. So oxygen is then released.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:38
There's something called the electron transport chain, which establishes an energy gradient, I should say AN, like AN, energy gradient.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:48
Um, electron transport chain basically takes all of those

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:52
um, energized electrons that we talked about.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:56
And it kind of holds them in a gradient.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:01
Excuse me.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:03
And it sounds kind of vague, but when I show you the picture, maybe it'll make more sense. But it's a series of carriers that pass electrons

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:11
to one another down a gradient, kind of like a… in, like, a stepwise fashion.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:18
And then lastly, Photosystem 1 reduces any DPH.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:23
So, these energized electrons, which were captured by the electron acceptor, are then passed to the NADP plus molecule,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:31
And that is reduced to become NADPH, which I mentioned earlier.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:38
Okay? I know it seems super complex, I'm saying a lot of new words,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:42
But again, don't super focus on the details. Um, again, just focus on the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:49
Um, the summary that I gave you guys before, but do know what Photosystem 1 and Photosystem 2 are. They're just pigment complexes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:58
that help gather solar energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:03
Pigment complex, meaning they have a lot of pigment, right? They have the chlorophyll,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:08
in with them, and they can absorb a lot of solar energy. Yeah, Brandon.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:16:16
Um, can you briefly explain that again?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:16:20
How does photosynthesis affect chlorophyll? Like, what gives it the green?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:16:26
I missed the slide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:28
That's okay. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:31
I'm trying to think what slide. Just that chlorophyll,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:35
is a pigment, it's a color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:37
And it's a molecule that is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:41
embedded in the thylakoid membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:44
within the chloroplast,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:46
Which is within the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:49
you know, plant cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:51
So, the chlorophyll, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:56
It helps to absorb solar energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:00
So that's why the thylakoids are green,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:03
And that's why this part of photosynthesis

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:07
happens in the thylakoid, because it's absorbing the solar energy

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:13
Um, with the chlorophyll,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:15
That's exciting, all of these electrons, and doing all of these things, like splitting water and producing NADPH and things like that. Does that make sense, Brandon?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:17:25
Yes, it does, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:26
Okay, no problem.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:28
So this is what it looks like visually. Again, here we're looking at the left side of this figure, the

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:34
light reactions, so let's start over here at the bottom. So we have…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:39
Solar energy coming into Photosystem 2. Remember, this happens first.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:45
And Photosystem 2 is this pigment complex. It's like an antenna for solar energy, right? It's very…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:52
attracted. The solar energy is very attracted to it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:55
So, once the solar energy goes into here, we have water being split.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:01
So, once it's split into its components, you have H and O, right? So, hydrogens are being released, and oxygens are being released.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:10
So the hydrogens go somewhere else, the oxygen is being released, and that's the oxygen that plants produce, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:18
So then, once you have these electrons that are getting super excited, and you can look at this graph on the y-axis, energy level, and you can see it increases.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:28
So here is the Photosystem 2, all the electrons in there are getting really excited.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:33
Once they get, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:35
excited enough, they go to this electron transport chain that can turn ADP plus phosphate into this ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:44
And then this happens again. We want to do more stuff, so we have Photosystem 1,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:49
that absorbs solar energy at a certain energy level, and then that increases even more.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:54
And then we can combine this hydrogen ions,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:58
And the NADP+.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:00
into any NADPH.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:03
And remember, NADP+,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:05
And also ADP plus the P.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:08
This came… those two came from the Calvin Cycle and were given to the light reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:13
So basically, the Calvin Cycle uses the energy and gives the light reactions the scraps, but the light reactions can build back up those energy molecules

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:23
from this solar energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:25
So it builds up the scraps into usable energy again.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:31
Okay. So, again, don't worry about the details, but just… that's what it kind of looks like.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:36
So then now we'll go to the other side, looking at the Calvin cycle, and how we're going to make the sugar, how we're going to make the glucose and the carbon diox… er, the, um, carbohydrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:47
So, there's 3 different, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:51
phases, stages of the Calvin Cycle. We have carbon dioxide fixation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:58
We have carbon dioxide reduction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:00
And we have regeneration of RUBP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:04
We'll talk about RUBP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:06
In just a second. But…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:10
Um, after all of these steps happen, they produce this molecule called a G3P molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:18
And this molecule is kind of like the generic…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:24
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:26
the generic, uh, glucocarbohydrate, if you will.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:31
Okay, it's a generic carbohydrate. So then, depending on what the plant needs, it can turn it into glucose. Most plants turn it into glucose. That's why we say glucose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:42
But anyway, I'll show you these different phases.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:49
But again, I chopped off the figure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:52
And I'm showing you guys it on the right here, the Calvin Cycle reactions.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:21:09
Professor, how we know when infrastructure stations or reduction?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:16
I'll show you that in the next slide.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:21:18
Keep…

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:21:19
Okay, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:19
Yeah, I'll explain it, no problem.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:23
Okay, so to continue, now we'll start with fixation of CO2. So CO2 fixation, that's the first step.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:31
So what happens here is carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:36
is being attached to this molecule called RUBP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:41
Okay? RUBP…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:44
is only involved here. You don't have to worry about it for the future, but just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:48
RUBP is a 5-carbon molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:51
it's a molecule that has 5 carbons in it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:55
So, we have the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that's gonna attach to this carbon, um, this RUBP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:04
If the RUBP already has 5,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:07
And we see that the carbon dioxide has one carbon. If we combine them, how many carbons is that in total?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:13
Somebody tell me.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:22:15
Green.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:22:17
Takes?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:17
6, exactly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:19
So, this special enzyme called Rubisco, it's called Rubisco because it works with RUBP, so the RU and the RU,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:28
They create, um, this 6-carbon molecule from combining these two.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:33
So we combine carbon dioxide, we get the carbon, the C right here, from carbon dioxide, and we attach it to this, uh, RUVP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:43
And it creates a 6-carbon molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:46
Later, the 6-carbon molecule is gonna be turned into two separate

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:52
three carbon molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:55
Okay? So that's all that happens in CO2 fixation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:59
We're fixing the CO2 to the RUBP to create a molecule that can be used in the next step.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:08
So now we have reduction of carbon dioxide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:11
There's a sequence of reactions that uses the NADPH, which is that energized…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:17
Um, energy molecule that came from the light reactions,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:21
And it also uses some of the ATP, that energy from the light reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:28
To reduce carbon dioxide into G3P,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:31
the carbohydrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:33
Okay? G3P, remember, is the general name of the carbohydrate, which can be turned into glucose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:43
And then the regeneration of RUBP, that's when we come back to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:48
after the fixation, not after the fixation, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:52
to follow up with it. Um, regeneration of RUVP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:57
It uses ATP, which we know is the energy source.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:00
from the light reactions to regenerate… sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:04
to regenerate the RUBP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:06
So, RUBP combines with the carbon dioxide to create that 6-carbon molecule, which will be processed later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:14
Thank you!

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:18
I thought I felt another one, sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:21
And then it goes on through the Calvin Cycle. So then what happens to the REDP? It already went through and went on to the Calvin Cycle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:29
So we have to regenerate our UBP

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:32
in order for this cycle to continue, to continue to fix more CO2, to absorb more CO2,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:38
from the atmosphere.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:41
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:46
And this is what it looks like in the figure form. Again, don't be afraid. This looks scary, but it's not.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:53
We're just looking at the Calvin cycle reactions, and you don't have to memorize this, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:58
So here we have carbon dioxide getting absorbed. This is the CO2 fixation

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:04
stage of the Calvin Cycle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:06
carbon dioxide comes and attaches to RUBP. This is RUBP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:12
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:15
5, 5 carbons, and the carbon dioxide has 1.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:18
So then it becomes this 6-carbon molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:22
Which then, in CO2 reduction, gets split into two.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:26
So there's two…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:29
3 carbon molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:31
ATP is going to be used from the light reactions, and NADPH is also going to be used in the light reactions, and

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:40
it's gonna be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:42
producing glucose and other organic molecules. Basically, that is producing the G3P.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:49
Okay? It's the G3P that can turn into glucose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:54
And then from there, we have regeneration of RUBP, which is this 5-carbon molecule, and then the process can start over again. And it goes over and over and over and over.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:04
Okay? That's how plants…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:07
can make their own energy, can make their own glucose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:11
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:14
Again, I'm not going into the super details here, you guys don't have to know all of these details, but that's why this figure is a good summary.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:21
The one at the top, the little one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:23
That I showed you that it was bigger earlier.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:27
So, G3P, like I said, is produced, and this can be used for many different things. So, it can turn into glucose,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:35
Depending on what the plant's needs, it can be turned into cellulose,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:38
Um, cellulose is more of a structural carbohydrate. You can see it's used here for the leaves.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:44
It can be turned into glucose, it can be turned into sucrose, which is more of a…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:49
A simple sugar, like in these grapes, there's sugar in grapes, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:53
Or it can be turned into starch, which is also a structural carbohydrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:59
So G3P is a generic sugar that can be turned into other sugars depending on the needs of the plant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:06
Okay. Make sure you guys are remember that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:16
Okay? So G3P is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:22
a kind of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:23
you know, generic carbohydrate that can be turned into whatever the plant needs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:31
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:33
So now we'll talk about variations of photosynthesis, but let's take a couple-minute break. Um, everyone come back in 5 minutes. I know I talked a lot already, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:44
Let's come back in 5 minutes, and then we can do this last little bit, okay? See you at…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:51
632.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:27:52
Professor, can you just put the other one back?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:54
Yeah, for sure.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:27:55
I'm sorry, I'm still sick.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:56
No, you're fine. You're all good, don't worry.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:27:59
Thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:37
All right, everybody, come on back.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:43
We can finish up here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:48
Okay, so the last little part is we're going to be looking at the variations in photosynthesis. So there's a couple different types of plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:57
to look at.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:00
The first is C3 photosynthesis, and I'll show you how…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:04
all of these are a little bit different from each other, but C3 photosynthesis is basically the normal type of photosynthesis. Everything that I just covered.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:14
It's the same thing. So, these are most of the plants you're gonna see.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:20
Um, this happens with areas with moderate temperature and moderate rainfall, so not too much rain, not too little.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:28
Not too hot, not too cold, it's just, like, kind of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:32
you know, a pretty…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:34
average range.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:37
And it's called C3 photosynthesis,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:40
Because after the carbon dioxide fixation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:44
That happens in the Calvin Cycle, the first detectable molecule is a 3-carbon molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:49
So we know this because, remember, the RUBP, which is the 5-carbon molecule,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:56
Combined with the carbon dioxide, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:59
to get a 6-carbon molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:01
So after carbon fixate, or CO2 fixation happens,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:04
That 6-carbon molecule is broken up into two

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:08
3 carbon molecules, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:10
So we have 3 carbon molecules, so that's why it's called C3 photosynthesis, and that's right here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:17
And, um, carbon dioxide fixation, CO2 fixation, and the Calvin cycle both occur in the mesophyll cells, aka

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:27
the plant, you know, plants out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:29
This might be a little bit different for other plants that we see.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:33
So, please know that T3 photosynthesis, um, is what happens with most plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:39
It's called C3 photosynthesis because the first detectable molecule

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:45
After CO2 fixation is a 3-carbon molecule?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:53
And…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:54
It happens in areas with moderate temperature and moderate rainfall.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:02
Honestly, it's helpful just to know all of these, too.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:05
be able to compare to the next slide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:07
The next couple slides.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:11
I'll stay here for a second, I know it's a lot of words.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:44
Okay? So that is the 3 photosynthesis. Next, we have C4 photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:51
Those are basically the two types, C3 and C4.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:54
But within C4, there's a subsection.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:57
called CAN photosynthesis, which we'll talk about in the next slide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:01
But C4 photosynthesis,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:04
is for more, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:07
plants that live in hot, dry conditions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:10
We're not talking about the desert.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:13
Okay, that's the next one, but we're just talking about more warm,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:18
um, warmer temperatures,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:20
less rainfall conditions, okay? And this is their adaptation for it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:25
So, they're called C4 photosynthesizers because after carbon fixation, carbon dioxide fixation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:31
The first detectable molecule is a 4-carbon molecule, so exactly the same as before,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:37
Except instead of a 3-carbon molecule,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:39
it's a 4-carbon molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:43
Okay, so it's a little adaptation for photosynthesis from the normal photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:49
carbon dioxide fixation happens in the mesophyll cells, with the leaf

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:54
The plant leaf cells, right? The plant cell?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:57
Just like I talked about before,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:59
But another difference here is that the Calvin cycle occurs in the bundle sheet cells. So these are new

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:06
cells that we have not learned about.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:08
But if you look at this anatomy here, comparing

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:11
On the top, we have the C3 plant, which is the normal plant, and then we have the C4 plant adapted for warmer conditions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:20
Um, we have the… the anatomy looks a little different, right? It's kind of on the C4 plant, it's kind of like a circular ring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:28
You have the mesophyll cells around here, and you have the bundle sheet cells

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:34
within the inner circle. And these are just different types of cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:40
Um, within…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:43
you know, within the plant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:45
And this red thing here, this is a vein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:49
Um, not vain like blood. Plants don't have blood, but they do have

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:54
water and different nutrients that they can soak up through these veins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:59
So, the anatomy is a little bit different, um, like I mentioned, that's the last point here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:06
And, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:10
the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:14
um, Calvin Cycle occurs in these bundle sheet cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:18
The next slide…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:21
Well, I guess that's an excellent, it's fine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:24
So, this is an adaptation for the hotter and drier conditions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:30
Um, it kind of breaks up photosynthesis to happen in

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:34
multiple places, in case one part of the cell

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:38
um, gets too dehydrated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:40
So, it can still…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:42
it can still happen. But anyway, this is C4 photosynthesis, so this is hotter, drier conditions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:50
Within C4 photosynthesis, we have another exception, or we have another category.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:55
That's called CAM photosynthesis, C-A-M.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:00
And this is common in the desert environment. So, this happens in plants like cactuses, right? Like cacti or succulents, things like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:10
So this is, like, extremely, extremely dry, almost no rainfall.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:15
very, very, very hot temperatures during the day.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:19
And pretty cold temperatures at night, but mostly the desert, you know, hot, dry environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:26
So, the difference here is that carbon dioxide fixation…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:32
that first step, right? That happens at night.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:35
Okay, I'll explain why that happens in just a second.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:39
But here you can see, at night, the carbon dioxide is getting fixed into the cells, into the Calvin cycle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:47
at night, while during the day, the glucose is made.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:51
So, during the day, the C4 molecule releases carbon dioxide to the Calvin Cycle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:58
But the advantage

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:01
of the carbon dioxide fixation happening at night,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:06
is to conserve water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:09
Okay? So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:12
think about it. In a desert environment, super, super hot, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:18
If you open up your…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:21
basically when, um, the plants are absorbing this carbon dioxide, they have to open up their little pores.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:28
to absorb the carbon dioxide. They can't just absorb it through the cell walls, right? There has to be little openings.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:35
So if those desert plants

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:37
open up their little cells,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:40
During the day to try to get the carbon dioxide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:44
They're gonna dry out, right? It's so hot, the little cells, they're gonna dehydrate. All the water is gonna evaporate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:51
So they don't want that. They only open their… the little cells are called stomata,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:57
They only open those at night when the temperature is cooler.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:01
And when the sun isn't out, so that way they don't get dehydrated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:05
So they can still do their job, they can still absorb the carbon dioxide and use it, um, in the Calvin cycle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:13
But they do, um, carbon fixation. They absorb that carbon dioxide at night.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:21
And that is to conserve water. That is the main point I want to drive home here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:26
CAM, the main advantage

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:28
of CAM photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:30
is to conserve water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:34
Okay.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:41:38
I have a question, Professor, because I love, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:39
Yeah.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:41:44
I love captors, I love, uh, succulents.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:46
Mm-hmm.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:41:48
So, it's better to water them at nighttime.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:41:52
Then during the day?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:54
No, you can water them whenever, um, especially in Miami, like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:59
This is… it's not just talking, like, yes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:03
cacti and succulents are CAM photosynthesizers, but because they don't currently live in the desert environment,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:11
Um, you don't need to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:14
to water them at night. You could water them at night, but you could also water them, you know, during the day.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:19
In general, if your plants are outside, it's best to water them in the morning or in the late evening.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:26
So that way, the soil and the plants can absorb most of the water. If you do it during the day,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:32
it'll evaporate more, right? Not saying it'll evaporate all of it, because we're not in a desert,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:37
But it's best to water them early morning when this… before the sun is out, or at night.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:43
After the sun has set.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:45
Um, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:47
Given that you could water it at any time.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:42:49
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:50
the cacti, because we're not in a desert.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:42:52
Yeah, I see that, because when I plant them,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:55
Mm-hmm.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:42:55
Some of them, they die, and I'm like, but wait, they're supposed to be, like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:58
Mm-hmm.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:43:01
be, you know, like a desert plant, but why it's not here? But now I understand it's because they're not in their own environment that is different environment for them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:10
Exactly. Exactly.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:43:11
Okay, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:13
And be careful not to overwater succulents as well, because I'm…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:18
they don't… they're not used to that, so don't overwater them either.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:43:19
That, um, they don't…

[Lilian Valencia] 18:43:21
Okay, I have, like, a little section where I just put the cactus and then just the cichollets around.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:22
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:29
Nice, that's awesome. I love plants, too.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:34
Hi, okay, so that's it for this lecture. Please make sure that you know this figure. I blew it up nice and big.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:41
You can take a screenshot of the screen right now, you could put a little star next to this, um, take a picture on your phone,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:48
But again, you have to memorize this figure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:51
I'm gonna be testing you…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:53
you know, I'll be blocking out certain words here, and you'll have to know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:57
So, this next exam has a little bit of memorization, but it's important that you know this, because this is

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:05
photosynthesis, in a nutshell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:06
Okay?

[Antonella Diaz] 18:44:09
Question.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:09
Okay. Yes.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:44:12
So, you see how, like, the ADP plus P and the NADP plus… even in the order where they're situated, like, the one on top and the one on the bottom?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:20
Yeah, because I'm not gonna block out everything, I'm only gonna block out certain things.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:26
So, for example, if I only block out any DP+,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:30
Um, an ADP plus P, I don't block it out, like, you can see it. It's obviously not ADP plus P, right? Like, it has to be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:39
NADB+, you know what I mean?

[Antonella Diaz] 18:44:42
Okay, yeah, I get it, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:43
Like, the order… you're right, the order doesn't matter, it's just that what's coming in and what's going out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:48
But I'm not gonna block out everything. So, basically, you just have to fill in the blank for what's missing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:56
Okay. Any other questions, guys?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:01
Makes sense.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:03
Okay, I'm gonna stop the recording.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:07
And then whenever that uploads, it takes some time to upload
