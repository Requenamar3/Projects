[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:23
plan.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:25
He's trying to destroy him. Who does he say?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:29
Othello, I hate to break the bad news to you, but Desdemona is sleeping around with…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:36
Whom, guys?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 08:51:37
Pass you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:37
Very good. Casio.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:41
All right, so this is what we're going to see in Act 3, and it gets so bad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:45
And I'll go continues

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:48
to feed lies to him,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:50
about the situation and torture him so much so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:54
He has another stroke, okay? So again, that's the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:59
once, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:04
All right, so I want to read some of your

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:08
analysis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:10
For those who submitted on time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:21
Wow. I'm reading Able. Abel Acosta, you there?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:31
Oh, he's not here today.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:34
I'm reading a little bit of his, it's really, really…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:38
Beautiful. Very well written.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:40
But since he's not here…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:44
We'll go to the next one.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:52
Daphne, you're here!

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:55
Can you read yours to us?

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:53:00
Yes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:04
Okay, so this is her title, Othello's Defense.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:08
A modern rewrite by Daphne Alvarez. So,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:13
Pay attention to her modern analysis so you can give her

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:19
Um… feedback.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:21
positive feedback, or whatever you choose, I guess. Okay, go ahead, Daphne.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:53:26
Hello, everyone. Honorable Senators Barbanko. I promise you guys, I didn't use any dark magic or secret spills,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:53:34
Tooth Snatcher does the one I'll wait. My only trick, if you can even call it that, was telling the honest story of my life.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:53:41
If you listen for just a second, I'll explain exactly how I won her over.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:53:46
for Bontu. You know how you invited me to your house all the time? Well, every time I came over, your guests practically begged me,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:53:54
To tell all the crazy events of my life, all the ups and downs, the dramatic shifts in my luck.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:00
I went through my military career, the brutal fights, the long standoffs, and how I got every single scar.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:07
Listen, I recounted my military history down to the last detail.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:11
I didn't skip the parts where things went wrong or the losses we took. I told every single battle I won,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:18
Every near means, and every conflict, I barely managed to survive.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:22
I described in detail the strategic blockades that dragged on forever.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:27
Leaving us starved and exhausted. And then the sheer adrenaline of run… of…

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:33
adrenaline rush of a direct decision…

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:35
This is decisive,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:38
assault. I even pointed out the precise spot where I took a spear wound.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:43
And the lingering ache of old gunfire.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:48
This wasn't some casual war story. It was my autobiography. Lived in the thick of things

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:54
And laid bare for her.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:54:57
I had to share the most dramatic events of my early years, the one that still waked me up.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:02
At night. I told a terrible story of the time I was captured by the enemy,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:07
held hostage and then sold into slavery.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:10
The odds of my getting free were practically zero.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:15
But I laid out the incredible unlikely series of events that led to my eventual freedom, and my path back into service.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:23
I described the high stakes, life-or-death journeys I took, the time my ship was totally destroyed, and I survived, clinging to a wreckage in a storm. And the truly bizarre encounters that kept me from giving up

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:36
and give anything to spare.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:39
I talked about my…

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:41
I talked about massive deserts.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:44
The kind that steal your breath and cook you under the sun. I describe the terrifying caves and giant animal dens I had to shelter in just to survive at night. I spoke of mountains with peaks so high, they seemed to kiss the sky.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:55:58
And the air was thin, and every step was agony. And the most captivating parts, I think, were the people.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:04
I told tales of the most unusual folks I've ever encountered. Tribes in far of lands, people who believed and lived in ways that would completely blow…

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:15
Your sophisticated European minds. They had weird rituals, different gods,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:19
customs that defeated all logic, and I witnessed it all firsthand.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:25
All this crazy, fantastic, high-stakes stories, does Zemona adore them?

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:29
She just devoured every word. I noticed it immediately.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:33
When she got pulled away by her mother to help

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:36
with some routine chores, she apologized quickly and rushed off.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:40
But she never stayed away for long. She would bolt right back,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:44
Always finding some excuse to pause near me. Her eyes wide and fixed on mine, listening with an intensity that made it clear she was desperate not to miss a single detail.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:56:55
When I finally caught her alone, I realized how deep her interest was. I told her I would give her the full, complete summary of everything, condensed it into one private conversation.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:57:05
start to finish. I didn't leave anything out. When I was finished laying out my pass,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:57:11
She started crying. And it wasn't just superficial crying. She bowled her eyes out because she felt such a deep connection to the sheer scale of the intense suffering I had survived.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:57:22
That gentleman was the only smooth dog I used.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:57:25
That was the extent of my pursuit.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:57:28
She loved me for the dangers I faced and overcame, and I fell in love with her because she had such a genuine, sympathetic response to my struggle and survival. That is the entire magic act.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:57:40
If you want to call it… if you want to call that witchcraft, prevent you, then fine. Log me up, because I'm guilty.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:57:47
But only guilty of love, of to people connecting over a life story.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:56
That was great, Daphne.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:02
How'd you feel?

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:58:08
It's definitely a lot, because he's explaining all that he went through, along with why…

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:58:14
She fell in love with him

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:18
Yeah. Do you see how specific…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:23
when you analyze a chunk of text, how much you learn?

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:58:29
Yes, because you have to read it a few times to be able, like, to comprehend exactly what they're

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:35
Yeah. So, on our first initial read of the speech,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:39
You miss a lot of details, right? So you have to…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:42
do these exercises, these long speeches, and analyze them so you…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:50
understand the details. So, I'll tell you what I learned.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:54
The sphere wound!

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:57
I never really caught that. So, he alludes to the fact that he got speared.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:59:06
Yeah, and also to the fact that he still has, um, old shots inside of him. Probably because at the time, they weren't able to take them out.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:16
Oh, my goodness.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:18
So, he got speared a couple times, but then there's the remaining part is still inside his body.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:59:27
the remaining part of gunfire that he took.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:31
Oh, man.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:33
See, so that makes us… that makes me empathize.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:38
and see the greatness that is Othello, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:44
I mean, he survived things that most of us would not.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:49
Really?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:53
He was captured. He was held hostage.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:57
And then sold into slavery.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:02
And I guess he witnessed, right, the cannibalism with the other

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:08
slaves, and he was on a ship, and the ship was destroyed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:18
You say here, my ship was totally destroyed and I survived, clinging to the wreckage in a storm.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:28
And he kept from… I kept from giving up and giving in to despair.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:37
Massive deserts, cooking under the sun,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:40
Terrifying caves, giant animal dens. It's really, really good, Daphne. You did a great job.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 09:00:46
Thank you, Pro

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:48
I just graded it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:57
Very, very good job. Okay, let me see who we have.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:03
Alright…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:15
How about, uh, Raul, are you here?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:29
Um, Raul, are you here?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:38
He's logged in, but…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:15
I'll ask again. Raul, are you here? You're logged in!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:19
Where'd you go?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:26
That's not good, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:28
to log into the class and then disappear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:31
That's not good. Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:38
I'm looking for… oh.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:42
Sharvan, are you here?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:56
No, he is not here. Oh, there he is!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:06
Bro, can you hear me?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:14
Siobhan is not here. Raul is joining now, so hopefully he can read his.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:28
Daniel, I know you're here.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:03:32
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:36
Can you read yours to us, Daniel?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:42
Okay, um, you want to read it?

[Daniel Herzog] 09:03:46
Yeah, let me just pull it up

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:47
Take your time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:57
How'd you guys… did you like this module? I think it's really great.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:02
And you… she did a great job.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:04
Daniel, I'm reading yours. It's really great. It gives you guys…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:08
In terms of comprehension, like, a really, really good insight

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:14
on what the character's saying.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:04:17
Yeah, I was to kind of understand what he's saying, because some of it's in Old English, but when you kind of read it over, right?

[Daniel Herzog] 09:04:23
You learn what the true meaning is.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:24
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:26
Yeah, you do learn what the true meaning is, and really,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:30
you're… you're, like, making references, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:35
inferences. You're… sometimes you're just guessing, but you can figure it out, right?

[Daniel Herzog] 09:04:35
Yeah.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:04:40
Yeah. Okay, I'll go ahead.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:42
Because some of these words, you don't even know… you don't know what they mean, but…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:46
you get a sense, uh, you know, you make inferences, just like you do

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:52
in other English classes. You kind of guess what you think is going to happen.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:57
Uh, okay, Daniel, we're ready for you when you're ready.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:01
Okay, I'll go ahead. Most honorable and respected gentlemen, and to you, my Lord Barbentino.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:08
Yes, it is true. I did take your daughter, who is now my wife.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:13
But that is all I did wrong.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:16
There is no Dark Art, spell, or potion that I use to attract her to me.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:22
I'm not a smooth talker, or practice speaker of Love's soft words.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:27
I've lived all my life on the battlefield, not in ballrooms.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:32
From the time I was strong enough to carry a sword, up until just recently, my arms had known nothing but war and loss.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:41
I have fought, bled, and survived by skill and steel, not by flirting.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:46
So, if you are expecting poetic speeches, you will not find any.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:52
But I will tell you honestly,

[Daniel Herzog] 09:05:54
And truthfully, how your daughter and I came to know and fell in love with each other.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:01
You think I've used witchcraft's honor, but the only magic I know is truth.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:07
Here's what really happened.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:10
You yourself invited me to your home several times. You asked me questions about my life.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:16
My journeys, my battles, and the hardships I have went through.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:21
I told you everything.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:23
Near-death experiences, ambushes, scars, the years of slavery.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:28
And ultimately, my escape from it.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:30
I told you of deserts so wide, they seem to swallow the sun. Mountains that appear to touch the sky.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:38
And men from distant lands, some so strange that they were said to have faces on their chests.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:45
You listened with deep interest.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:47
Just like Desdemona.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:49
At first, she'd come and go.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:52
Pulled away by house duties.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:54
But each time, she'd rush back to listen.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:58
I saw in your eyes that my words touched her heart.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:03
Later one day, she asked me to tell her everything.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:07
The whole story of my life.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:08
I agreed.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:11
As I spoke, she cried when I told her of the pain and loss of everything I had survived.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:17
Her compassion was pure, her heart open.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:21
When I finish, she sighed deeply, and said my story was strange.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:26
Sad and beautiful.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:28
She wished she hadn't heard it, yet couldn't help but be moved by it.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:33
She said if a man loved her, he should learn to tell a story the way I did.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:39
That was the moment I understood her heart.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:42
I took that as a hint, and confessed my love.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:47
She loved me for the dangers I had endured.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:49
For life, I lived.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:51
And I loved her, because she felt my suffering so… because not only did she felt my suffering so deeply,

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:57
Because she saw me not as a soldier, or a Moor, but as a man.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:08:02
That is the only enchantment I ever used.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:08:05
No potion, spell, or charm.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:08:08
Just the truth in my life, inner courage to love me for it.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:08:13
If you don't believe me, here comes this demona herself.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:08:17
Letters talk for me.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:08:18
Let her tell you how our love was created not by witchcraft,

[Daniel Herzog] 09:08:22
By the joining of two souls through honesty and compassion.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:26
Wow, Daniel.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:28
Thank you!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:30
That was beautiful, Daniel!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:34
What do you think, everyone?

[Keren Romero] 09:08:40
It was very deep, and that's why I really liked it, and it was very detailed as

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:44
And hearing it from a male's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:47
point of view, and a male's voice is really, really good.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:50
I particularly love this.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:54
And I loved her because she felt my suffering so deeply, because she saw me not as a soldier or a moor,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:01
But as a man, that's excellent, Daniel.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:09:05
Thank you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:14
Really, really good. I'm just skimming.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:18
around…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:21
Near-death experiences.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:24
I told you everything. Near-death experiences, ambushes, scars, years of slavery, and my escape from it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:32
Desert so wide, they swallowed the sun. Mountains.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:41
Men from distant lands, so weird.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:44
To have faith… wait, some so weird-looking.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:47
that they were said to have faces on their chests.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:51
Unbelievable.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:56
So this gives more insight on, you know, Brabantio knows him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:02
For Banto's familiar with his…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:06
experiences, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:11
So now, when Othello says in this speech,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:14
when he pauses, like, with tears in his eyes…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:21
he says she…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:25
thanked me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:31
So now, do you see why that's such a big deal? I mean, he was never treated nicely, just like Daniel said, he was always…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:39
being tormented, always abused, always…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:43
you know, fighting and chaos, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:47
fight-or-flight mode, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:49
You guys understand fight-or-flight mode?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:55
Do you know what that means, guys?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:11:03
Yeah, it's a constant stress.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:04
Yeah, it's fight or flight.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:07
on your physical body, you're constantly fighting and stressed,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:11
And trying to survive.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:13
So he was constantly in survival mode.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:18
That's why he had a stroke.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:21
And, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:25
So, for him to say she thanked me…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:29
Like, you may question, why is that a big deal? Because to Othello, who's been tormented, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:36
in survival mode, and fight-or-flight mode, and it's like, nobody…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:43
thanked him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:44
He was constantly…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:49
in conflict and trying to survive. So, for her to say, oh, thank you, is, like, incredible.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:57
That was really good, Daniel. I heard two really great ones.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:02
It's just, I feel…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:06
a lot of empathy for Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:09
Because it's like, finally now in his life, he has peace and love.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:12:16
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:19
And Iago takes it all away.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:23
So, when does Othello ever have moments of reprieve and rest?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:28
And joy and love when he's with Desdemona, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:34
We all know that evil Iago takes it all away.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:40
And when we get into Act 3, it's just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:45
We talked about catharsis, you know, when you feel sick to your stomach.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:51
I'll go in Act 3, is gonna make you sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:53
Because he just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:58
Beat. Beat…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:59
Beat, beat Othello down to the point.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:03
or he has a stroke, he can't take it anymore.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:07
It's really bad. Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:11
Let me see something, because I have to explain to you…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:15
Um, you guys are gonna have to do a module on…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:21
plant and animal metaphors.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:23
Did I mention that to you?

[Keren Romero] 09:13:27
Yeah, I think you did.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:29
Yeah, I think I get two, because I told you guys to keep your eye and ear out for plants and animal metaphors.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:36
But maybe I should…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:39
give you a lecture today

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:41
Because it's very important, and now we're getting into Act 3, so I think you're ready for this lecture.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:47
So, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:52
Let's read a few more…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:55
of the speeches,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:57
the rewritten speeches from Act 1 will take a little 10-minute break, and then I'll give you a lecture on the plant and animal metaphors.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:05
really important lecture.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:09
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:10
So, let's do a little bit more reading of these, and then we'll pause for 10 or 15 minutes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:16
And then I'll get into plants and animals.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:20
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:24
Raul, you here?

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:28
Yes, yes, I'm here.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:29
Hi, can you read yours, please?

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:31
Yeah, absolutely.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:32
Okay, thanks. We're ready for you when you're ready.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:36
Uh, my Lord, I grasp your concern, and I see the pain expressed in your career.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:40
You cannot comprehend how your daughter…

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:43
A woman born in luxury, comfort, and with noble men every society,

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:47
We've made the decision willingly to select me. Soldier.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:50
I mean, a war. And most importantly, an outsider in your world.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:55
You suspect that there must have been an illicit trick of some sort.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:14:58
Perhaps some dark incantation.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:00
Or something that impaired your sound judgment.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:03
But I swear, before heaven,

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:05
before this council and before you, that I have to utilize in the magic. No spells, no charms.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:10
or herbs, or the seed of any kind.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:13
The only spell I used was the Spell of Truth.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:15
The story of my life, to be exact.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:18
And after sharing it, speaking truly from the heart.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:23
You know, my lord, that when I came to Venice, you frequently welcomed me into your house.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:27
You accepted me, and requested that I recounted the tales of my voyages and the wars I fought in service of Inis.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:34
I recounted many years of burial.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:37
of a living death by the narrowest margin.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:39
of being captured and sold by its enemies as a boy.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:42
And which I then overcame to attain my freedom.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:46
I attributed the label of the shirt to Landscapes of interminable sand.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:49
And the change of mindsens to crack so high that their pigs were forever lost in clouds.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:54
I described the peculiar many inhabiting those values.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:15:58
Men whose bodies were jammed and withered by the land they occupied.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:16:02
Cures and habits engendered by those lands are peculiar as to seem savage to the managing gaze.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:16:08
I spoke no to show off, but simply to respond to your request.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:16:19
Do you want me to continue?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:21
Um, I'll pick it. I'll read for you a little bit. Desdemona paid attention.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:26
For the most part, when I… while I recounted my narratives,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:31
When she was not sewing,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:34
He would incline forward, or take a back,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:37
from her work, then watch the rhythm of my words.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:45
Occasionally, when I had stopped,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:50
asked me to go on to narrate more.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:55
I could remember to share the most dangerous moments, the narrowest escape,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:02
the losses that had hurt deepest.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:07
I suspected it wasn't bloodshed and glory that fascinated her, but what it was to endure.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:16
what it meant to survive when it seemed all was lost.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:23
She felt pity for me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:26
Not as if she were downcast, but as one heart recognizing

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:31
the pain of another heart.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:36
There were moments after you left for your business when she would call me back to relay some part of it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:45
Tell me again, she would say.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:49
The time you were alone in the desert for 7 moons.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:53
Or, tell me again how you broke free from your chains.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:02
are completely and truthfully

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:03
without any kind of show.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:06
I did not realize at the time that her sympathy was gradually changing into love.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:12
I did not anticipate it. I did not long for it, but she was listening.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:20
really listening, as no one had before.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:24
In her gaze, I was not a curiosity, nor an alien,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:29
to be examined.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:33
But a man with a soul.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:36
worth listening to.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:39
After I finished my story one night, she sat quiet for a moment.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:44
Then she said something I will never forget.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:47
She said if a friend of hers had lived through what I lived through, the danger.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:52
The isolation, the victories, the pain, she would love him for it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:00
That is when I knew.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:03
That is when I saw her heart had chosen me already.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:08
even though neither of us

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:11
had said the word love.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:15
If you consider that witchcraft, you mean it is a type that the world needs more of.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:22
The only…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:27
I don't know what this word is. The only blank on me

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:32
Were my crowned, my mouth offering in the world, and the crowbird was born

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:38
of truth and memory, not subterfuge.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:41
She loved me by virtue of what I had braved.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:45
And I loved her to have courage.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:49
And having braved

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:51
what I had braved.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:53
Ours was love that did not grow in darkness, but in the light of a shared humanity across tribes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:04
You, my Lord, accuse me of having taken your daughter's heart, but I tell you to not be fooled.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:10
She had given it, and she had given it in the full knowledge

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:15
of what I am.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:17
And not in delusion.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:21
She chose me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:23
Not in pursuit of gold.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:26
Not for title, and not for power, but simply for the courage I had shown to endure in a world where

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:35
on occasion, most do not endure.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:39
And for the audacity that poured from me what she may have considered genuine love for me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:45
You know me, sir.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:47
I am not known in Venice for being treacherous.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:52
I have been loyal to this state.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:54
have shed my blood, and have only sought honor as a reward.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:59
If I were capable of corrupting or bewitching,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:21:03
Where I stand before you now, confessing it?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:21:08
No. I only stand here offering the truth.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:21:11
the same truth that one Desimon's heart.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:21:15
Our bond is not a matter of which, but rather the most ancient magic in the world.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:21:21
understanding relationship and a fellow truth.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:21:26
Raul, that was beautiful.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:21:31
What do the rest of you have to say to Raul?

[Raul Ayvar] 09:21:40
By the way, I'm sorry to bother, but I apologize if there are some mistakes.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:21:44
I haven't had a luck to, um, read, um…

[Raul Ayvar] 09:21:48
these types of, um, writings when I was young, so…

[Raul Ayvar] 09:21:52
I ask AI for some guidance and help with how I write.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:21:54
I know, but that's okay if you guys used AI for this. I don't mind.

[Raul Ayvar] 09:21:59
Thank you, thank you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:00
Raul, where are you from?

[Raul Ayvar] 09:22:02
Uh, Peru.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:04
Peru!

[Raul Ayvar] 09:22:05
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:06
So do they teach Shakespeare in, like, high school or whatever?

[Raul Ayvar] 09:22:10
Uh, I mean, we've seen some movies about it, but we haven't read anything at all about it, so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:16
And do you like it so far?

[Raul Ayvar] 09:22:17
Sorry for my ignorance sometimes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:21
Do you like the play? Do you like the story thus far?

[Raul Ayvar] 09:22:25
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty interesting because he touches some themes that…

[Raul Ayvar] 09:22:29
are not commonly seen in writings that you would… you would see in high school, for example, so I'm pretty…

[Raul Ayvar] 09:22:36
Um, flame map with what I'm seeing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:39
Yeah, it's truly incredible. And here in the U.S.,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:44
Shakespeare is pretty much mandatory.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:47
starting in high school. They start, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:51
teaching Shakespeare to high school students, and then…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:54
goes on from there, but it's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:22:56
I really think understanding

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:00
Shakespeare's motivations behind his plays,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:05
can't be duplicated. It's, you know, gives you this insight into humanity, and human nature

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:13
to the extremes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:15
Like, it is extreme. His stories are extreme.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:20
You know, so he's saying,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:24
maintain your moral code within you so you don't…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:29
live a life with these extremes, because it isn't healthy, and someone's gonna die.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:35
Let's read one more ladies, and then we're gonna take a little break, and I'm gonna give you the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:43
lecture on plants and animals.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:46
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:23:49
Samantha, are you there?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:24:04
Samantha, are you here? You're in the room.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:24:17
Okay. She's here, but she's not here. Guys, I don't know what to do about this. I'm gonna talk to other professors who teach these online classes and ask them if they…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:24:27
make it mandatory to leave the cameras on.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:24:30
Because it's really not good for people to be coming and going and coming and going, given the fact that I give you guys

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:24:36
Huge breaks every hour.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:24:39
So, I'll see how the other professors work.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:24:43
Um, so Samantha's here, but she's not here.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:24:49
Allison, are you in the room?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:25:00
Allison, think, you're here, but you're not here.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:25:06
Are you here?

[Allison Fink] 09:25:06
I'm here. Yes, I'm here.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:25:08
Oh, good, you're here. Okay, Allison, would you mind reading yours?

[Allison Fink] 09:25:17
I was just listening in, I'm not sure, um, where we really are.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:25:24
Allison, you should know, it's already 9.30. We've been doing this for, uh, an hour, almost. Okay, we're in module…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:25:37
4. Rewriting Othello's speech analysis in

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:25:42
Act 1. Um, so can you read your analysis that you submitted in Canvas?

[Allison Fink] 09:25:50
Yes, I already didn't know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:25:51
That's okay. It sounds really good. I just read the first paragraph.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:25:55
So please read it so we can all enjoy what you wrote.

[Allison Fink] 09:26:03
Sorry, it's taking a little bit to load.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:26:06
I don't know, that's okay, as long as you're here with us, it's okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:26:24
I'm just reading it. Oftentimes, a lot of you commented in your analysis that

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:26:31
Othello, when he was in the wild, met men whose heads seemed to grow

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:26:38
from their chests. What does that mean?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:26:41
That means they were hunched down, they were hanging down. Is that what that means to you guys?

[Allison Fink] 09:26:52
Yes, I have it here now.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:26:54
Yeah. Okay, Allison, go ahead.

[Allison Fink] 09:26:59
You ask it if I use witchcraft to make Destimona love me. No, sir, I swear.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:04
There was no magic, no potion, no tricks, just the truth of who I am and what I've lived through.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:10
My story won her heart.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:12
Whenever her father invited me to his house,

[Allison Fink] 09:27:14
He would ask me about my life, about my travels, my battles, the dangers I faced,

[Allison Fink] 09:27:20
And the strange places I've seen.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:22
I spoke of deserts and vast oceans,

[Allison Fink] 09:27:25
of men who fought fiercely.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:27
of being captured and sold into slavery.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:30
And how I finally escaped.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:32
I told stories about my cliffs and caves, about the wild things I've seen,

[Allison Fink] 09:27:37
Cannibals and men whose heads seem to grow from their chests.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:41
It may sound unbelievable,

[Allison Fink] 09:27:43
But those were my experiences.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:46
And Desimona would, for a while, seem…

[Allison Fink] 09:27:49
Heedless off her guard.

[Allison Fink] 09:27:51
And ere I parted, begged me to repeat the rest

[Allison Fink] 09:27:54
Another time. Her eyes, so full of wonder and compassion,

[Allison Fink] 09:28:00
Telling me what a sad and pitable tilt it was, and how unworthy such villainous fortune

[Allison Fink] 09:28:09
Were I to have crossed her love and peace,

[Allison Fink] 09:28:12
threw me from her side to absence.

[Allison Fink] 09:28:15
When I finish one day, she said, quiet,

[Allison Fink] 09:28:18
Softly.

[Allison Fink] 09:28:20
that if a man had loved her and told her such a story,

[Allison Fink] 09:28:24
She'd want him to tell her more.

[Allison Fink] 09:28:27
It was her pity and admiration that drew me to her.

[Allison Fink] 09:28:31
Me not magic, nor trickery.

[Allison Fink] 09:28:34
So, no, I did not steal her heart with witchcraft.

[Allison Fink] 09:28:37
She gave me it of her…

[Allison Fink] 09:28:40
Own free will. My only magic was…

[Allison Fink] 09:28:43
In the honesty of my words, and that…

[Allison Fink] 09:28:46
in the life that I have lived.

[Allison Fink] 09:28:48
She loved me for the battles I'd fought and the dangers I had to ride.

[Allison Fink] 09:28:52
I loved her because she drew me…

[Allison Fink] 09:28:55
for who I am,

[Allison Fink] 09:28:58
Just a soldier, but a man who had endured much and still stood strong.

[Allison Fink] 09:29:02
If loving somebody for their story is a crime, then yes, I am guilty.

[Allison Fink] 09:29:07
But not of witchcraft, only of being honest.

[Allison Fink] 09:29:10
That's someone who fell in love with my experiences with the strength it took me to overcome them, and the way I shared them with… from my heart.

[Allison Fink] 09:29:17
That's the truth, my lord. Nothing more, nothing less.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:29:25
Very good, Allison. Great job. So, what do you all think this image of

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:29:33
Othello saying, whose heads seem to grow from their chests.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:29:41
What do you think… what is that? What does he mean, Allison?

[Allison Fink] 09:29:47
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:29:48
I mean, what does that mean? He's seeing men whose head seemed to grow from their chest.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:29:53
I mean, if you think about the image of it,

[Allison Fink] 09:29:56
that, like, I've seen, like, men that…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:29:58
It would be…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:00
Does it mean their heads were, like, hanging down?

[Allison Fink] 09:30:03
Yeah, pretty much.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:05
Because they were starved and exhausted.

[Allison Fink] 09:30:08
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:10
That's exactly what it means, because he's saying, I've seen cannibals and men whose heads

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:16
seem to grow from their chest because they were so weak, and so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:21
starved, and so exhausted that they were like this.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:26
trekking along. Is that what you think? I do.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:31
pretty awful image, actually.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:33
I mean, it's a powerful image.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:35
I've never heard anyone ever say that before, except Shakespeare, whose men

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:40
whose heads seem to grow from their chests.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:44
That's because they're weak, and starved, and exhausted.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:49
Wow, wow, wow, wow. Good job, guys, the ones we read. Thank you all.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:56
for sharing. Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:30:58
Let's take a break, because…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:01
we need… you guys need to hear this animal…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:04
plant and animal lecture.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:13
I am.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:25
All right.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:27
So, it's 9.30, let's take a, you know, 15-minute break.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:33
And then we will get into…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:37
the lecture on plants and animals.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:41
those metaphors in

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:45
Othello, okay? So, take a break.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:51
we will reconvene…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:31:57
like, 9.45.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:32:00
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:07
Um, alright guys, welcome back. So…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:11
Let's get into this plant and animal, the use of plant and animal metaphors,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:18
or motifs, okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:21
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:24
First, we have to talk about

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:28
what a motive is, right, in a play.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:43
Alright. Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:45
So…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:51
What's a motif?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:53
Guys, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:55
You can see on these slides, we'll define it a little bit, so you…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:03
kind of get a sense of what a motive is, so we can define it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:08
Right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:12
So, how you will be able to identify and analyze motives in the play Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:19
They're similar to metaphors.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:20
Right. So…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:24
What is a motive?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:28
Recurring images.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:32
that helped develop the stories

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:35
Theme.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:38
Okay? So, plants and animals.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:42
Let's start with animals, because it's a little easier and a little more obvious.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:48
In Act 1, Scene 1,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:50
where do we hear…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:55
animal references.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:57
Or metaphors.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:50:02
Yeah.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:50:03
Is that what he was called RAM?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:06
Yeah.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:50:07
I remember, okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:08
Yeah. Guys, make sure you take notes on where to find these

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:15
metaphors and the name-calling, the animals and the plants and such forth.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:19
Because you're going to have to write a rep, uh, an essay on this for next week. So I'll put it in the chat.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:29
And I will read a bit to you. So, motives. Recurring images that help to develop the stories

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:39
theme. So, in Act 1,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:42
Scene 1. Iago calls Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:45
a Barbary horse.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:52
An old, black,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:54
RAM!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:58
He also tells Brabantio that Othello and Desdemona are…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:03
what? Any of you remember?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:09
There you go? I'm teaching.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 09:51:11
making the beast with

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:13
Very good.

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:51:16
Which means they were intimate.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:18
Very, very good. So make sure you're jotting these down, guys, so you can…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:24
I'm helping you to make your… writing your essay for me easier.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:29
And that can be found Act 1, Scene 1, Line 117.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:36
Right? So, I'll put that in the chat.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:40
So I'm telling you exactly where to identify

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:46
these, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:48
Metaphors, animals, and plants, so you can…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:53
it's easier for you. So that's Act 1, Scene 1.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:02
Line 117.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:07
All right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:11
So that's all Act 1, Scene 1. Again, he calls Othello a Barbary horse.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:18
An old black ram.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:25
What does he call Desdemona?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:28
Remember, he says, you know, I hate to tell you this,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:33
reband you, but an old… but that old black ram is tapping your…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:39
What kind of animal? What?

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:52:40
White… white sheet?

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:52:41
Sheep, you… you…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:42
Yeah, white you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:45
And U is like a lamb. So you've got this…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:49
image, this metaphor of a ram,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:53
Versus…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:55
a little dainty white

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:58
Lamb.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:00
Alright, that's your motif, right? That's a theme, that's a metaphor with a strong visual…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:07
image, right? A ram is an aggressive animal, so you get… Burbancho's now getting this image of this

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:16
RAM, this aggressive animal going after his little white lamb, alright?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:21
So that's an Act 1, Scene 1. Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:24
Again, making the beast with two backs.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:28
Act 1, Scene 1, Line 117.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:31
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:33
So he says, uh, Barbary Horse, old back black ram is tapping your white ewe.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:38
He said your grand…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:42
Yay!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:43
Right? Implying…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:47
neigh, like a horse.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:49
So your grandkids, he calls them grandchildren, but…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:53
Same thing. Your grandchildren are going to

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:57
Nay, however you spell nay, okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:10
like a horse.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:13
So really, racial, derogatory,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:18
Painting this…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:21
image and this motive of Othello being a really aggressive animal.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:27
Okay? Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:32
Also in Act 1, Scene 3, Iago tells Rodrigo, ere, I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hand.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:40
I would change my humanity with a baboon. He's saying, Roderillo, you're so stupid if you're gonna drown yourself over Desdemona.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:48
Right? I wouldn't… I wouldn't drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, or…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:55
give up being a human being for a stupid baboon, right? So he's kind of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:02
reminding, using…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:04
Gaining hand…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:11
And Baboon…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:32
Right? So he's telling Rodrigo, you're stupid if you're gonna kill your… drown yourself over her. That's just dumb.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:40
Right? And that, guys, you can find that in…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:51
line… so, Act 1, Scene 3…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:01
Line 312.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:02
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:06
He then remarks, Iago then remarks that drowning is for cats and blind puppies.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:12
Again, stupid little animals,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:15
that are blind, that can't see straight.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:19
So he's saying, you know, Rodrigo, your judgment's off, you're being silly.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:24
And that cats and blind puppies is Act 1.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:27
Scene 3…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:34
Line 330, okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:40
Uh, Casio. Now we're moving forward.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:44
And to Act 2, where we see the animal metaphor.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:48
So, in Act 2, Cassio…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:51
lament that when drunk,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:55
He says, I am by and by a fool.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:59
And presently a beast. So he refers to himself as a beast.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:04
And that is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:07
That animal motif is Act 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:23
284, line 284.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:28
Okay, um, more animal.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:33
instincts, uh…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:39
Okay, we haven't gotten to this yet, but in Act 3,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:44
Othello tells Iago, exchange me for a goat.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:48
When I shall turn the business of my soul.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:52
to such exuffocate and blowed surmises. That's a hard line, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:58
And we haven't seen it yet. It's in Act 3, surmises are guesses, like,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:04
So he's saying to Iago,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:07
You can exchange me for a goat, Iago. You can treat me like I'm, um, dumb if you think I'm going to turn my soul

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:18
over your extravagant guesses

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:21
that Desdemona's cheating on me with…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:23
Casio.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:27
So again, the animal reference is Othello saying Iago.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:32
You can exchange me for a really stupid goat if you think I'm gonna believe

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:38
what you're telling me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:40
Okay? Then Othello goes on and says,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:45
a horned man's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:47
a monster and a beast.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:53
That's in Act 4, and then in Act 5, Amelia, in the final scene, says,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:59
I will play the swan.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:02
So all these animal references.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:04
And I'm going to give you Act 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:08
Which we haven't gotten to yet, but that's okay. You can…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:13
find it, and its acts…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:17
Three…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:18
Scene 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:25
Line 184.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:27
to…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:29
186…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:31
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:36
And then, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:38
when he says… Othello says, a horned man's a monster and a beast.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:42
That's Act 4, Scene 1.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:46
Line 59.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:48
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:52
So there are a…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:54
a lot of animal refugees. And then the final one is in…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:00
Act 5, Scene 2.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:02
Emilio refers to herself as a swan. So, there you go, you have that

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:07
image of a swan,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:10
Just like a lamb or a sheep, they're gentle,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:15
They're soothing, you know, they're not aggressive, like the old black ram.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:19
Okay? So that's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:22
Act 5, Scene 2,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:24
Line 254.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:26
And that is when Emilia…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:31
calls herself…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:33
a swan, all right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:36
So that's where you can find those references, those text references that you could put into your essay, alright?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:43
Um, but let me read a little more of this text. So, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:51
These references to animals.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:57
convey a sense, guys, that the laws of nature

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:02
Rather than the laws of society have taken over in Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:07
So, it becomes, in Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:10
the laws of nature,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:17
Versus…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:23
the laws of society. God, can any of you explain what that means?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:28
If the analysis is saying that in Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:31
It gets so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:34
crazy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:36
Excuse me, that it gets to a point

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:41
We're all the main characters are acting like animals, and the assumption is that the laws of nature have taken over Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:50
Rather than the laws of society. So what does that mean, guys, in your own words?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:01:55
Instead of treating him like a person, they're treating him like if he's an animal, pretty much.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:02:01
That's how I… I

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:03
Yeah, I mean, the animal instinct takes over.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:07
So nobody's following laws anymore.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:10
So, the laws of nature, guys, are the animal instinct.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:16
they're… everybody's just doing whatever they want,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:18
Versus the laws of society. So the laws of society, guys, are the laws.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:28
the governing body that makes sure everyone

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:32
in society are following the laws, following the rules, and acting accordingly.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:40
So, you know, for us now, the laws of the society, you know you don't go and rob a bank.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:47
You don't run through a red light. We know this. These are laws

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:53
of society.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:55
But…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:58
laws of nature are, you know,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:00
What we see on the news all the time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:03
People acting like animals, assassinating people.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:07
you know, stealing things, murdering people, doing bad things. They're acting like animals.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:14
That's the law of nature.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:17
That word, nature, implies

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:21
animal instincts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:23
You're not following the rules of society, you're following your own…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:29
internal chaos, your internal rules, your instincts. Does everybody get that?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:37
So, in Othello, the laws of nature, the laws of animalism and instinct, it's like they're all in a jungle.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:44
And it keeps getting worse and worse. Nobody's following…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:49
governing laws anymore. They're committing crimes left and right, and it gets really bad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:53
People are getting murdered.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:56
Um, okay, so that's that concept of animal instinct, and animal…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:02
the animal comes out in Othello, it comes out in Rodrigo, it comes out in, you know, Burbantio, and Iago, of course.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:11
And there's nobody's following laws.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:14
of society. They're all acting like animals, okay? Very dangerous.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:19
Um,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:21
Again, these references to animals convey a sense that the laws of nature, rather than those of society, are the primary forces

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:29
governing the characters in Iago… in Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:37
Laws of nature, animal instincts are the primary forces

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:43
governing the characters in this play.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:48
When animal references are used with regard to Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:52
As they are frequently, they reflect

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:54
Racism.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:56
Both of characters in the play,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:59
And Shakespeare's audience. Remember, this was 16…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:05
05, 1604.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:08
So they were racists.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:12
Barbary Horse is a vulgar term.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:15
that comes out of… who says that?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:23
Who says, oh, this Barbary horse ran off with your daughter?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:33
Who got… guys, who calls…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:35
Othello, a Barbary horse.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:47
Very good. Valentina says Iago.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:50
Yes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:52
Um,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:57
Okay, so that…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:59
explains the animal motif, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:05
Okay, now back to the slideshow.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:10
Because this is more about now the plant metaphor. So,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:14
Why does Iago always talk about plants?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:20
Which you probably haven't noticed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:23
This one's a little harder.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:27
to figure out, but once it's clear, you'll be like, oh, I get it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:38
So, what's the deal with

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:40
the plant metaphor. We understand animals,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:44
Now, let's focus on the plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:48
And why is he Augo?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:52
Try and figure this out. So preoccupied with plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:03
Anybody have a clue?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:07
Y, e-ago.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:09
is obsessed with plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:22
Why is Iago obsessed with plants?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:25
I know it's not clear to you, but it will be as soon as I explain it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:31
All right.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:35
Let's go back to some keywords. What does the word taint mean?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:41
to taint something.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 10:07:44
you make it dirty, you…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:47
You dirty it, you poison it, right?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 10:07:47
Yeah, you do me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:51
You contaminate or pollute something.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:55
Anybody have a clue how this word

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:00
is relatable to Iago? What is he contaminating or polluting?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:08:07
what everybody's thinking of, uh, Telo?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:09
Very good. So we're on track to understanding

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:14
why Iago is obsessed with plants. What's the word permeate mean?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 10:08:23
repel water, or… no.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 10:08:28
lead water through it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:30
Yeah, it permeates, it spreads.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 10:08:31
The purse.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:34
see what the spread through something and be present in… what does that say? In every part of it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:42
Okay, any clue why the word taint

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:46
Primal, relating to an early stage in development, or permeates, something spreads.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:52
Any clue what this has to do with Iago? Because these all relate to Iago, taint.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:58
Primal. Permeate. Again,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:01
what someone said about, like, your…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:04
contaminating, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:09
Anybody have any clue what Iago?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:12
has to do with these three words.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:18
He's contaminating something. He's polluting something.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:22
It's in the early stages of development.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:25
And it's spreading

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:29
through everyone. What is it?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:43
So what does eOgo spreading?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:46
What is he polluting?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:48
And what is in the early stages of development?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:09:57
For everybody to have doubts on Otello's love for the Simone?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:01
Uh, close, but it goes a step further, that

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:06
Desemona is unfaithful and having an affair with Cassio.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:12
Okay? So, how do we connect this to Iago's obsession with plants?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:18
Simple, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:21
Iago…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:23
It has planted the seed

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:28
of what?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:31
What is Iago planting the seed in Othello's mind?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:41
that Desdemona is being unfaithful and cheating with Cassio.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:45
He is polluting his ears.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:49
You remember, we got to that part.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:52
Iago says, I'm going to pour pestilence in his ears.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:58
I'm going to poison his brain. I'm going to plant…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:03
a seed, just like you plant a seed

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:06
for something to grow,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:08
I'm gonna plant that seed of envy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:11
And that seed of being unfaithful…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:17
in his ear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:21
Everybody clear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:28
Okay. So now let me read a bit from the text.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:33
on Iago's use

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:37
of the plan. That's what it is, guys. He's planting the seed of envy, and the seed of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:43
unfaithfulness in everybody's ear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:46
Okay? So, Iago is strangely preoccupied.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:51
occupied with plants. His speeches to Rodrigo, in particular,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:57
make…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:00
Sorry, guys. Make, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:05
Extensive and elaborate use of vegetable

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:08
and plant metaphors.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:11
Here are some of the lines, guys, that he says.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:15
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:18
In Act 1, Scene 3, Line 317, he says, quote, Our bodies…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:24
are our gardeners.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:25
No.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:27
That's wrong. Our bodies are our gardens.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:33
So what we plant in it is very important.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:37
You want it to grow healthy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:41
Right? You want it to flourish, you want your body to do well, so you plant it…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:47
with good things.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:49
Iago is poisoning Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:53
He's planting bad seeds.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:58
Okay? Um…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:13:00
Well, seeing as this, Professor?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:04
Um, that is Scene 1 act… oh, no, no, no.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:09
Act 1, Scene 3, Line 317.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:12
And I'll put that in the chat. So you can use these in your essay. When you explain to me the use

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:18
a plant, an animal metaphors.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:20
This is seeing Act 1, Scene 3…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:25
Line 317.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:28
There, okay? I put that in the chat.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:31
He continues.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:40
I mean, this is not easy, guys. Do you see how if you don't analyze it, and if your professors don't

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:45
Break it down and explain it to you. It goes… you don't notice it. That's how genius Shakespeare is.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:52
Like, none of you understood when I said, why is Iago obsessed with plants? Nobody really knows, because we…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:00
gloss over the text. That's why doing these very specific

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:05
analysis of these complicated texts

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:08
give you such insight into…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:11
these characters, okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:13
So, Iago goes on to say,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:21
Though other things grow fair against the sun,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:27
So, with the sunshine.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:29
However, fruits,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:32
that blossom first,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:34
will first be ripe.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:37
And then, I would gripe.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:40
and wring it with my hand.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:42
And slowly destroy it with my poison and kill it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:47
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:53
The first of these examples explains Iago's preoccupation with the plant metaphor.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:59
And how it functions in the play.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:06
Characters in the play seem to be the product of certain inevitable natural forces.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:12
So there we go. Natural forces, like a wild plant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:16
Right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:28
Right? Again, those… that shows

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:31
Laws of nature has taken over.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:33
Right? Like, wild plants. You plant… Iago has planted the seed,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:39
In Othello's mind, in everybody's mind, that Desdemona is a whore.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:44
And that word, whore, is used, I think, 25 to 30 times.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:49
in the play. So everybody believes Dezomona's a whore.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:54
She's cheating, she's lying, she lied to her father, she lies to Othello, okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:00
So it's a really poisoned seed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:05
that Iago has planted. That's why he's obsessed with plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:08
Um,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:14
These examples best explains, yeah, with the… okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:18
Um, characters in this play seem to be the product of certain inevitable natural forces which left unchecked,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:25
will grow wild.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:27
And weeds will overtake and kill.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:31
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:37
Iago understands these natural forces, particularly well. He is, according to his own metaphor, a…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:45
quote, good gardener.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:47
Both of himself and of others. So, I believe in Act 1, Scene 1, he tells Rodrigo,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:54
I am a very good gardener, meaning

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:58
I know how to plant seeds.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:01
of corruption and lies in people's heads.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:04
Because why? I am not…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:07
what I am. I am a very good gardener.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:14
Um, make note of this. Many of Iago's plant references include

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:20
Poison. So he says, quote, this is in Act 2, Scene 3. I'll pour this pestilence into his ear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:29
Whose ear? Othello's ear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:32
What's pestilence? Poison.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:35
And that is in Act 2, Scene 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:40
Line 330.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:43
Again, Iago says, I'll pour this pestilence into…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:48
his ear. The more already changes

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:52
with my poison.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:56
dangerous conceits are in their natures, poisons.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:00
Okay, he says…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:03
And this, you'll probably see today.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:06
Not poppy,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:10
nor Mandragora.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:13
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:19
shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:23
Okay, so he's talking now about poppies.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:29
Poppy plants?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:33
and Mandragora plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:36
Okay? So these two plant references are Act 3, Scene 3,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:43
Line…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:47
329.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:49
So now, what's… what do you guys know about poppy plants? Anything?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:56
Guys, poppies…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:59
are, like, heroin.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:02
they were used in the military.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:07
And World War I, World War II,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:09
Um, to numb…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:12
the brain, because our military soldiers, if they got injured, they used poppy plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:19
So poppies…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:23
are like heroin or morphine.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:25
Highly addictive.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:27
I'll look it up and read exactly what it does to your brain.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:32
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:34
they're… first of all, if you don't know a poppy, they're pretty, they're little red flowers, but what do they do?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:41
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:44
Most poppy plants are toxic.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:47
There we go, poison, right? And you see Iago referencing poppy plants. They are poisonous!

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:54
They, because of their alkaloid compounds.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:59
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:14
I'm reading more about… it's opium, guys!

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:17
That's what it is. It's a drug. Like, morphine, heroin,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:21
um, opium, opioids,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:24
comes… all of this comes out of the poppy plant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:27
It's a little red flower.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:30
very hazardous.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:20:32
So they're illegal, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:35
Yeah, they are illegal. Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:39
You should steer clear of poppies, opium poppy, from which heroin

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:46
and other opiate drugs are derived from.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:49
Not good, guys. So, they were given to our military because they were injured.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:55
And there were so many injured that

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:57
They realize if they eat the poppy plant, they're not in pain anymore. It's like heroin. It is heroin. It's morphine. It's opioid drugs.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:06
Um, very highly addictive and very dangerous.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:11
So, the opium poppy from which heroin and other opiate drugs are derived.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:17
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:29
Just reading more about them. You get the point, guys. They're very…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:35
It's opium, it's a morphine, it's heroin, it's not good, very dangerous. Anyway.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:39
So you get the point of why…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:43
Um, Iago says, like, Poppy? Poppy plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:49
That's what he's planting.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:51
And everyone's head. Uh, and then, guys, bad news, the Mandragora plants…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:57
are just as dangerous, if not more. Magicoras…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:02
If you want to look up what they look like, it's a root.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:12
Very dangerous.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:22:13
I'm reading that it's, um…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:22:17
If ingestion can cause…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:22:19
Paralyzed or death?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:22
It can paralyze you, it can cause death,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:25
And then… and you hallucinate, guys. You start seeing things, hearing things.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:32
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:47
very toxic. Here it says it's, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:51
It's use is fraught with risk due to its toxicity. The plant contains…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:58
Uh, tropane alkaloids.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:00
Which can cause severe side effects, including hallucinations, confusion, and even death.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:07
Um, and you went, due to these dangers, this man… mandrake root is not…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:14
It's not legal, and it shouldn't be used.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:17
Unless under strict supervision.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:22
Okay, uh, causes hallucinations, all kind of problems. So there you go, very toxic.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:29
And you can see what it looks like.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:34
All right, so there you go, guys, a plant and animal metaphor.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:38
Now, you… it's clear to you all how and why this is important to

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:46
Iago. Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:47
And he says here…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:50
this last paragraph.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:53
I also cultivates his ideas so that they become lethal poisons

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:59
And the plants, and then plants their seeds in the minds of others.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:05
The organic way in which Iago's plots

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:09
Consume the other characters,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:12
and determine their behavior makes his conniving…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:16
Human evil seemed like a force of nature.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:19
The organic growth

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:21
of his lies, just like plants indicate that the minds of the characters

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:28
are fertile ground for Iago's efforts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:31
All right? So that's your plant and animal metaphor. Um, let's quickly work our way through these…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:39
slides that you… I'm sharing with you, it will help you formulate your essay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:44
on plants and animals a little easier.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:47
So, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:50
Exploring the motive of plants and gardening.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:53
Okay, we understand.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:56
Iago is planting and gardening.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:01
Here you go. These are where you find them again.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:05
Act 1, Scene 3. Iago says, our bodies are our gardens to which our wills, our gardeners.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:13
Act 2, Scene 3, Iago says, though other fruits go… grow

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:19
Fair against the sun!

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:21
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:29
Yeah, they'll first be very ripe, and they'll blossom, and they'll be beautiful,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:34
Until I poison them.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:36
All right? So that's Act 2, Scene 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:44
Act 2, Scene 3. Big, big phrase. I'll pour this pestilence into his ear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:50
So I'm going to pour this poison

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:55
of infidelity and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:58
lies and envy into Othello's ear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:06
Act 3, Scene 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:08
As if he plucked kisses up by the roots that grew upon my lips.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:18
plucked kisses up by the roots.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:24
that grew on… that grew on my lips.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:27
I'm trying to…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:29
put that image in my head.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:33
to further understand what Iago says here.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:37
plucked up kisses by the roots, so you pluck them up.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:26:43
So that they won't grow anymore.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:26:46
Right? So, how I get it, so that they're love…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:26:51
won't grow as much. I'm gonna say my lies.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:26:55
for it to destroy it completely from the ground.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:55
That's very good.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:58
That's very good, Yannette, because he's plucking up their beautiful kisses.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:05
you're probably right, and then they don't grow anymore.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:10
All right, so jot down where you find all these phrases.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:15
And then let's go to slide… oh, yeah, see not poppy nor Mandragora.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:21
poisonous. Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:29
shell…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:29
put you in a sweet sleep.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:32
Because they're poison. I don't know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:38
Shall ever, shall never medicine thee?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:41
shall never put you in a… I don't know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:43
It's probably because they make you feel good, right? Heroin, opioids…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:48
I don't know, what is she saying here? He's definitely poisoning him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:56
Let's see the next slide, what I had came up with.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:01
All quotes are shared by Iago, all quotes link to gardening and plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:10
So, that's the gardening and the plant motif in Othello, alright?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:15
Um, so let's see what I came up with with the English

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:21
translation, and my…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:24
my own language. Iago says we can control our animal instincts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:29
We can control them.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:32
Which foreshadows his racist notion that Othello cannot

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:38
And does not exert the same control

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:43
over his animal instincts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:49
Iago is telling Rodrigo here to be patient.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:54
And that they will soon bear the fruits of their labor, the fruits of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:01
their revenge against Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:03
So he's telling them, be patient,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:06
My revenge is gonna work out.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:11
You're on my team, Rodrigo, and we're going to be rewarded.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:14
So Iago uses plant imagery

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:17
to camaraderie go down, because he's upset and flustered, because why?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:23
Does Damona married Althea?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:25
Okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:30
Iago now interweaves poison imagery into his gardening imagery. He will plant

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:35
poisonous seeds in Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:40
Iago manipulates Othello into thinking Desdemona,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:45
has been having an affair with Casio, and the poisonous seed of jealousy grows.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:52
Iago claims that no exotic plant will ever cure Othello into peace again. He is forever

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:58
tainted.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:02
Thus, his poison was successful.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:09
It's really brilliant, and it's really genius.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:13
that Shakespeare uses this whole plant and seed imagery

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:18
And metaphorically,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:21
So we all see what he's doing. He's poisoning, he's planting these poisonous seeds.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:29
I mean, I couldn't possibly think of a better metaphor.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:36
then a little seed being planted in Othello's head.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:43
It's unbelievable. It's so great. Okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:48
what connects each quote here?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:57
Oh, we already did that, okay. So…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:01
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:03
Let me see… So, a quick little… a few quiz questions, guys. Which character's lines

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:10
are permeated by the motif of gardening and plants. We already know Iago, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:17
What concept permeates

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:20
The motive.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:22
of plants and gardening, guys. Which one? Hell, death, poison, or beauty?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:29
Yeah, poison. Good job.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:31
He all goes gardening and plant imagery suggests…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:34
He is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:36
Helpful, tainting, frail, or lonely.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:47
Yeah, tainting, poisoning.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:53
What does the motive of gardening and plants suggest overall?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:00
that Iago goes planting

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:03
the seed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:05
of jealousy and envy and unfaithfulness, and lying, and all bad, bad

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:12
things into Othello's brain, Rodrigo's brain, everybody's brain, that she's a bad woman.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:21
We don't need to do that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:24
We're not going to spend time on that. I think that's it, guys, yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:29
We're not going to talk about other motifs. What were the animal motif, right? We got that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:34
That one's con… we're not going to talk about.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:37
the other ones right now.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:39
Okay, so there you go, guys. I'm going to stop sharing that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:43
So now you should be clear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:48
a module, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:51
5, which is due next week. And that's going to be to write a…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:01
I don't know how long it should be, one or two pages.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:05
Yeah, one of each. One page for the animal metaphors,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:09
And one page for the plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:11
And how they are used

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:15
in Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:17
Okay, so first page, animal, second page, plant, and whatever, or whatever order you want to do it in.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:24
That's going to be due next week.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:26
That's a lot to consume, a lot to digest.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:31
So, do you guys have any questions? Because you're going to write about this for me for next week.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:37
You feel like… what?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:33:38
The rating…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:33:40
writing it and explaining how we get it?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:33:42
how we understood it?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:44
No, I'm gonna say to you, I mean, the writing prompt is gonna be…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:33:44
Or do

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:50
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:55
How does…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:01
Let me think of exactly how I want to phrase it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:06
How are…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:08
the meta plants and animals

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:12
used in Othello by Iago.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:17
and other characters.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:19
Really, Iago just uses… he's the only one that talks about plants.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:25
And he's the only one that uses the plant metaphor.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:28
But when we get to the animal metaphor,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:32
people are talking about animals and making references to animals throughout the whole thing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:37
You know, we have Casio. When he gets drunk,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:40
He refers to himself as a beast.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:43
Othello refers to himself as a beast.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:46
Um, then we have the Barbary horse, the neighing, the black ram, the white ewe.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:52
Then we have…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:55
Um, Rodrigo talking about, you know, drowning himself, and Iago says, oh,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:01
I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hand, and… or…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:05
give up being human for

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:10
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:12
the love, my love of being in love with a baboon, that's how stupid you're being right now, Rodrigo.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:17
Okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:19
And then, again, in the end, which we haven't seen yet, we see Amelia saying, I will be the swan.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:26
So what do we know about swans?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:28
They're delicate, they're beautiful, they're feminine, right? So again, guys, throughout the whole play, we have this

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:36
animal, this raging…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:39
aggressive, violent,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:44
beast versus…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:46
The white U, or the white swan.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:50
Okay? Why is it so prevalent? Because these animals…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:54
These beasts end up killing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:58
The white you and the swan.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:02
So, it's important for you to understand both the plant and animal metaphors. Again,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:08
Plants refer mostly to Iago, but the animal references are prevalent throughout, because remember,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:14
I told you that the laws of nature take over in Othello. They all turn into animals, like,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:20
It's out of control, and no one is following laws.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:26
of society.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:28
All right. Any questions on that? We are not going to get to method acting, because it's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:33
too much for today?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:37
Um, so we're going to take a break.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:41
And then we're going to tackle…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:44
start getting into Act 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:47
Act 3 is really intense.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:50
It's really horrible, it's really aggressive.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:53
It's heartbreaking, it's sickening,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:57
what's the power in Act 3?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:36:59
And especially Act 3, Scene 3,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:03
is that Iago goes all out.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:06
torturing Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:08
poisoning his mind, pouring pestilence into his ear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:14
It's so bad, and he never…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:17
gives up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:19
It just keeps pouring the poison, and pouring the poison,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:23
To the point where Othello has a stroke.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:26
can't handle it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:29
Iago doesn't care.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:32
Like, he's on the floor having seizures and having a stroke. Like, he can't… his body and his mind can't take it anymore.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:39
And what does Iago do? He gets down on his knees and keeps shouting in his ear horrible things.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:46
Oh, yeah, she loves Casio, and they did this, and they did that, and they did this, and she has his Hank.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:37:52
She gave him his handkerchief. It means torture, okay? So, let's take a break before we get into…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:38:00
the hell that is Act 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:38:02
So it's 1037, take a break, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:38:05
And think about the plants and animals, because it's a lot.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:38:09
And we'll meet at 11, and we'll…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:38:12
finish watching… I don't think we're gonna read any of Act 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:38:17
Because it's almost going to be 11 o'clock.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:38:20
I don't know. We'll see how far we get. Okay, take a break, and I'll see you in 15.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:59:59
Well, okay, gosh.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:01
All right, we're off to Act 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:04
Um, so do me a favor, log into Folger.edu, get to Act 3,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:10
I'll read the synopsis, and we'll do…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:14
5 minutes of reading, or 10 minutes of reading, and then we'll watch the film.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:19
Um, alright, so, ACT…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:22
Three Scene 1, guys!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:25
All right, so what just preceded this?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:30
What happened…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:33
the end of Act 2. What was the big event?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:51
What was the big event in Act 2 on the island of Cyprus? What is just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:00:57
happened? What did Iago set up?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:01:18
I know you know, folks, what happened in Act 2? What was the big…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:01:22
Event.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:01:25
What happened to Cassio?

[Samantha Viza] 11:01:36
Iago convinces, um…

[Samantha Viza] 11:01:38
Casio to drink, even though he doesn't handle alcohol well.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:01:43
Very good, and what happens?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:01:56
What does… what ultimately happens to Casio in Act 2?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:07
Do we need to go back a little bit and watch Act…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:10
the end of Act 2?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:14
We all know that Casio gets drunk. Yes, Iago sets it up, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:20
Very good, Valentina Casio gets fired!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:30
All right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:33
That's the big event in Act 2. Casio…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:37
is fired. He gets drunk and gets into a fistfight,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:41
Othello says, I love you, Cassio, but no more be a soldier of mine.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:49
So we all go wins, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:50
Casio gives him his sword, takes off his lieutenant's sash,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:02:55
And says, my reputation, my reputation, my reputation.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:01
is ruined!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:04
The immortal part of myself,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:06
is destroyed, and what is left is bestial.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:10
I'm a beast!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:13
Okay, so now, guys,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:15
I am in Act 3, Scene 1. I will read the synopsis. Cassio arrives with musicians.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:21
So he's already been fired.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:25
He arrives with musicians to honor Othello and Desdemon.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:30
Now, this is very important for Act 3, as Iago…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:36
has recommended Casio asks,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:40
Amelia…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:42
arrange a meeting with Desdemona.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:46
Does any of you… do any of you have a clue?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:51
Why Casio wants to arrange a meeting

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:03:56
with Desdemona. For what?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:05
Why does Iago want to get Cassio?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:09
hooked up with Desdemona.

[Samantha Viza] 11:04:12
So I can make Othalo jealous.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:14
What? Oh, she's saying so they can make Othello jealous. Yes, exactly.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:20
But here's the way he does it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:22
He says to Cassio,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:25
You have to get together with Desdemona.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:29
And tell her

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:31
that you want to be reinstated as lieutenant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:38
So meet with her.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:41
In secret, do it quietly.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:43
And asked as Amona for help.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:47
to get his job back as Lieutenant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:51
So guys, why is that such a big deal? Because…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:56
it puts…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:04:59
Desdemona and Casio together

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:02
whispering in each other's ears like they're in love.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:06
So, it looks…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:08
As if they're telling secrets to each other, which they are.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:15
So, why is this so dangerous? Because when Othello sees them speaking to each other, it looks like they're

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:23
in love, but they're not. Hold on.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:35
I've finished up my class, but…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:37
Stop in the dryer, he's asleep. I have, like, another half hour, okay? Alright.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:42
So, folks, it's very dangerous because…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:46
Iago was putting Casio

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:49
With Desdemona in secret.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:05:54
So, anyone seeing them chatting privately and whispering to each other in the corner,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:02
looks like they're lovey-dovey, having an affair.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:05
But that's not what they're talking about.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:08
They're talking about… Casio is saying, Desdemona, please.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:12
Please try and get

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:14
my job back as lieutenant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:17
tell Othello I didn't mean and I just got drunk.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:20
You know, so that's what they're talking about, but it appears

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:24
as if they're having an affair. Do you guys get that?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:28
So that's Iago up to his dirty tricks again.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:32
All right, so again, Act 3, Scene 1, the synopsis, as Iago has recommended

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:39
Casio asks Amelia to arrange a meeting with Desdemoni, even though Amelia assures him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:44
Desdemona is already urging Othello

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:49
to reinstate him as lieutenant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:06:52
Okay? Um…

[Yanet Sanchez] 11:07:04
So just by Desimona…

[Yanet Sanchez] 11:07:07
trying to convince or tell her to reinstate him, it kind of seems like…

[Yanet Sanchez] 11:07:11
You want your lovers to still be here.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:13
Yeah, and you're gonna see what happens.

[Yanet Sanchez] 11:07:13
Right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:16
Because this is Act 3, Scene 3,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:20
Upstage, Casio is talking to Desdemona.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:25
And he's like, he has… he's on his knee, and he has her hand,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:31
in his hand, and he's like,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:33
pleading with her, please, please talk to your husband.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:36
Please try and get my job back as lieutenant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:40
And Iago walks in, and Othello is right behind him,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:45
And Iago looks at them upstage,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:48
With Casio on his knee, holding her hand,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:50
And, like, begging and pleading,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:53
And Iago says the worst thing ever.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:07:56
He says he looks at them, and he says, oh…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:00
I like. Not.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:03
That.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:06
And that's what starts the whole planting of the seed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:11
You'll hear him say that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:13
He says, ah!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:17
I…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:19
Like, not,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:22
That.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:25
That simple phrase,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:28
stops Othello in his tracks, and he says,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:31
What did you say?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:34
What did you just say? And I'll go says, no, nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:40
Othello says, No!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:42
You just saw Casio with my wife, and why did you say I like not that? What's going on?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:49
So, you're gonna see…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:52
The seed is now planted. Iago goes…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:08:56
the master at corrupting and poisoning his brain, and you will see Iago…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:03
go completely insane.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:05
He loses it. Turns into an animal,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:07
You can't even think straight anymore.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:10
Okay? With that simple phrase, uh-huh, I like not that,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:15
Casio is upstage on his knees with Desimona, and he's kind of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:19
kissing her hand and pleading.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:21
I don't like it. And then it sets Othello off into…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:26
have a stroke.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:29
So let's do a really quick read.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:34
Let's get to Act 3, Scene 3. We'll just read a little bit, and then…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:42
I mean, this is very, very powerful. All right, so I'm now reading the synopsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:46
of Act 3, Scene 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:49
Uh, Destimona's interview with Casio is cut short by the arrival of Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:09:57
Her interview includes them talking about how he's going to get his job back.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:03
Casio leaves hastily!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:05
He rushes off.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:07
When he sees Othello and Iago.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:10
So, Casio leaves quickly in order to avoid speaking with Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:15
Desjemona pleads to Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:19
On Casio's behalf. Please, Othello, give him his job back. He's the best general, the best lieutenant,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:26
He loves you, you have to give him his job back.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:29
When she exits,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:32
Iago says…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:34
Casio's avoidance of Othello is suspicious.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:39
Because I don't like what I just saw.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:43
And you know what, Othello Cassio may not be honorable.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:49
All the while insinuating that he, Iago, knows more than he's willing to say.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:57
He warns Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:10:59
against becoming jealous of Desdemona.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:03
This is when Iago says the famous line,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:08
Oh, I'll tell you!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:11
Beware of jealousy!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:13
It is the green.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:16
Monster.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:18
Okay, so y'all goes…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:21
planting the seed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:24
When Destimona enters and Othello complains of an aching headache,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:28
Does Demona offer to bind his head with her handkerchief?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:33
The handkerchief is an important prop, and a huge symbol in Othello, okay? You'll find out why.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:41
As they exit the handkerchief,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:45
Desimona drops it on… unnoticed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:48
On the ground. Amelia picks it up and gives it to Iago, who often asks for it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:54
Othello re-enters, and now tormented by jealousy,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:11:59
threatens Iago with death unless he provides proof.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:03
That Desdemon is cheating.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:05
Guys, he uses the handkerchief as proof.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:10
He plants it somewhere.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:13
that it shouldn't be.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:15
So what's the importance of the handkerchief? Where does it come from? Guys, the handkerchief was given to Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:21
by his mother, who's

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:24
Her mother gave it to his mother.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:27
And her mother's mother gave it to her mother, and her mother, and her mother. So it's a family heirloom of love, of commitment,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:34
Think of it… think of it as, like, a wedding ring or an engagement ring.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:40
So it's been passed down.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:44
And Othello got it from his mother, and he gives it to Desdemona.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:50
A white handkerchief with

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:53
Strawberries, hand-sewn.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:57
it's gone missing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:12:59
Othello says, I have a headache, give me the handkerchief.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:02
And she pulls out a plain old handkerchief, and he says, that's not the handkerchief. The handkerchief that I gave you, where is it?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:10
she starts to get very nervous. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know where it is.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:14
He's enraged.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:16
Alright, so the handkerchief is proof

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:19
that they're having an affair of… because where Iago

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:24
plants it. You'll see.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:26
Um, so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:31
Othello threatened Iago with death. He says, I'm gonna kill you, unless

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:36
You provide proof of Desdemona's

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:38
infidelity. Iago alleges…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:42
that Cassio one night was talking in his sleep about making love to Desdemona.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:47
And that Casio wiped his beard with a loss.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:53
handkerchief.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:55
Othello is convinced by this proof

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:13:58
And vows to kill Desemona.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:01
And Iago agrees.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:02
to kill Casio.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:05
A fellow then appoints…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:09
Iago? Oh my god, you scared me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:12
Iago to the lieutenancy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:20
Alright guys, Act 3. Very important scene. Again, what you need to know is that

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:25
Casio has been advised

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:28
to beg for Desdemona to get his job back.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:32
Why is this so important? Again, because it puts Casio and Desdemona

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:39
physically together and whispering in each other's ears, so it looks

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:43
like they're having a love affair.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:46
That's the first thing that you gotta know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:48
The second thing that's really important

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:51
is this handkerchief business.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:53
Because the handkerchief is the proof.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:14:57
that she's cheating.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:15:03
All right. You know what? It's already 11.15. Let's read for 5 minutes, and then we'll put the film on. I'm looking what we can read at.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:15:14
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:15:33
Okay, guys, I want to read Act 3, Scene 3, Line 100.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:15:38
It's between Othello and Iago. That's all we're going to read today.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:15:43
Um, but this is where doubt has been cast, and Iago says, I don't think, uh,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:15:49
Casio is very honest, and you better watch him with your wife.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:15:53
Okay, so Act 3, Scene 3, Line 100, I need an Othello and an Iago.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:15:59
I'll read Othello, I need an Iago.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:12
Anybody want to read, um, Iago?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:16
Daniel, can you read it with me, please?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:16:23
Okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:23
Okay, thanks. So, Act 3, Scene 3. Very important scene.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:29
We're at line 100.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:32
Um, are you ready, Daniel?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:38
You got it?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:16:39
Yeah. Yeah, Act 3, Scene 3?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:41
Yeah, and then go to line 100, it starts with Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:44
All right, Othello says, excellent wretch. Perdition.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:16:45
Got it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:50
Catch my soul, but I do love thee.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:54
And when I love thee NOT,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:16:57
chaos is come again.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:06
Daniel, you're up.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:17:07
He's at Act 2, Scene 3, or Act 3? Scene 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:10
Act 3, Scene 3.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:17:13
Okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:14
Okay, I'll start over. And guys, notice what he's saying. Oh, I really love you, Desdemona, and when I don't love you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:20
chaos is gonna come.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:22
So, again, uh, Othello sets excellent rich.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:28
perdition catch my soul, but I do love thee.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:32
And when I love thee not…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:35
chaos is gonna come.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:17:38
My noble lord.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:39
What thou sayest, O Yago?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:17:45
Did Michael Cascio, when you wooed my lady,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:17:49
Very good, from first to last. Why shalt ask?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:17:55
But for a satisfaction of my thought.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:17:56
No further harm.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:00
No way up?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:12
We're at line 110, Daniel. Why of thy thought, Iago?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:18:19
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:22
Oh, yes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:23
And went between us very often.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:28
Indeed, I indeed, didst thou art in that?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:33
Is he not honest?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:18:35
Honest, my lord.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:36
To be honest, I honest!

[Daniel Herzog] 11:18:39
My lord, for aught I know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:41
What dost thou think?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:45
Thank my Lord, thank my Lord, thou echoest me, as if there were some monster in thy thought.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:51
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something. I heard thee say, even now.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:18:57
Thou likest not that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:00
When Casio left my wife,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:03
What is thou not like?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:05
And when I told thee he was of my counsel, in my whole course of wooing, thou'st cried,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:12
Indeed!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:13
And just contract.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:15
And purse thy brow together, as if then hats

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:19
Shut up in thy brain, some horrible conceit.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:23
If that's log me e. Argo, show me thy thought.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:19:28
My lord, you know I

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:30
I think thou dost.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:32
And for I know thou art full of love and honesty, and wastest thy words before thou givest some bread.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:38
Therefore, these stops of thine fright me more.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:44
For such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:48
in custom.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:50
But in a man that's just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:19:53
Their close dilations working from thy heart, and that passion cannot rule.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:19:59
For Michael Casio, I dare be sworn, I think that he is honest.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:20:04
Hmm, I think so, too.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:20:08
Men should be what they seem.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:20:10
or those that be not, would they might seem none.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:20:14
Certain men should be…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:20:16
what they see.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:20:20
Why, then, I think Cass

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:20:24
Nay, yet there's more in this.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:20:29
I privy, speak to me as to thy thinkings.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:20:36
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:20:39
The worst of words.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:20:42
Good, my lord. Pardon me.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:20:44
Though I am bound to every active duty.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:20:47
I'm not bound to, that all slaves are free to.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:20:51
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:20:56
As wires the place whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:00
Who has that breast so pure?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:02
But some uncleanly apprehensions keep Leeds in law days and sessions, sit with meditations lawful?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:21:11
Those conspire against thy friend, Iago?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:21:15
If that boss thinks him wronged…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:21:19
And makest his ear a stranger to my thoughts.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:25
I do beseech you, do I perchance and vicious in my guess.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:30
As I confess, it is my nature's plague to spy into abuses.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:35
And after my jealousy.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:37
Shape faucet or not.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:38
That your wisdom from one that's so imperfectly concedes would take no notice.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:44
You know, build yourself a trouble.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:46
Out of his scattering and unscrewed, unsure observance.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:51
It were not for your quiet nor your good.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:53
Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:21:55
To let you know my thoughts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:21:58
What does sound mean?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:02
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:05
It is the immediate jewel of their souls.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:09
Who steals my purse, steals stress.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:12
Say something, nothing.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:14
Twas mine, tis his, and has been slave to thousands.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:19
But he that filters from me my good name.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:23
Roms me of that which not enriches him.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:25
It makes me poor indeed

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:22:28
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:32
You cannot. If my heart were in your hands.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:36
Nor shall not, will still tis in my custody.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:22:39
Huh?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:42
Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:43
It is the green-eyed monster with doth mock the meat it feeds on.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:48
The cockhold leaves in bliss.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:51
Who, surgeon of his fate, loves not his wronger.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:22:55
But oh, what damn minutes tells Yoher, who dotes yet doubts.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:23:00
suspects it strongly loves.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:23:03
Oh, misery!

[Daniel Herzog] 11:23:07
Poor and content is rich.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:23:09
and rich enough. But Rich's fineless is as poor as a winter.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:23:13
To whom it ever feels…

[Daniel Herzog] 11:23:15
Fears he shall be poor.

[Daniel Herzog] 11:23:18
Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:23:25
Um, okay, guys, we're gonna stop, because it's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:23:28
25 after I want to get into the film. There you go, guys. The seed has been planted.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:23:35
Um, Iago sees upstage Desdemona, Cassio's on his knees,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:23:40
kissing her hand, pleading,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:23:43
And Iago says, I don't like what I see.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:23:52
stops Othello dead in his track. What'd you say? Oh, nothing. I didn't say anything. Yes, you did.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:23:57
What do you mean by that? And then you see the conversation goes on, and he says, oh my god, sir,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:08
Beware of jealousy. It is the green-eyed monster.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:12
So now…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:15
Othello's really going mad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:17
And he says, why should I be jealous?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:21
What are you telling me? What do you know? What's happening?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:25
So, you'll see the torture continues,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:29
And Othello gets sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:31
physically, mentally, he unravels completely.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:35
Alright, no more of me today. Let's get into Act 3C3, so you all know where we are.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:41
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:45
And I will show you the exact scene.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:50
Where he says, oh, I like not that. I don't like what I'm seeing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:24:55
It's just bad. I mean, it's really bad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:25:08
Give me a minute to pull it up, and I'll screen share.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:25:26
All right.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:25:49
without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself, such a loser.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:25:57
What, man, there are ways to recover the jet bro again. Give another cast in his mood!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:02
A punishment born in policy, then, in Paris!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:05
Kill to him again at his job. I will rather seek to be despised.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:09
But there seems so good a commander with so slight, so tranquil, so indiscreet an officer.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:16
run consulting, kind of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:18
I've squabble, swagger, swear, of discourse bustion with my own shadow.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:24
Oh, now, invisible spirit of wine, and thou hast no day to be built by, let us call.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:26:30
Cool.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:30
The devil, right?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:26:31
Now, we can see the screen.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:34
It should be now, do you see it?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:26:36
Now…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:36
No?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:26:37
Uh-uh, it's all green. Oh, now, edit.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:41
Okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:43
A call, but nothing wherefore.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:46
Okay. I'd mention for an enemy in their mouths.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:49
You were wearing that very specific job.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:52
by a rebel, pleasure, and applause, transform ourselves into…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:26:56
Be scarf! Good wine is a good, familiar creature, if it be well used.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:01
And the lieutenant, I think you think I love you. I have well approved it, sir.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:06
I don't know why.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:09
I shrunk!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:12
You're in a male living drunk, it's such tough.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:18
I tell you what you should do.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:21
Our general's wife is now the germ.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:24
Compete yourself private

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:27
Hey, fortune her! She'll have to put you into a place again.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:31
This broken joint between you and her husband.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:34
I treat her to Splinter, and my fortunes against any lay-worth name. This crack in your love so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:40
Who grows stronger than it was before.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:45
Advise me well. I protest in a sincerity of love and honest kindness.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:50
I think it freely.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:27:52
And be times in the morning will I receive the virtuous death demona to undertake for me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:01
I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me. You are in the right.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:07
roadbags, no tenant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:10
I must do the watch.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:28
Honestly, Open.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:43
I don't know! Rodrigo Rico!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:46
Hydrofollow here in her chase, not like a hand and hands, but one that pulls up…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:53
I don't know, it's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:55
I think it is almost spooked.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:28:58
He tried exceedingly well, Cato.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:00
And I think…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:03
The issue will be, I should have so much experience for my paint, and so with a little…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:10
Well, with no money at all. Return again to Venice. How poor are they that have not patience?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:16
What wound?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:18
Sorry, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:21
But if we

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:25
By wit, and not by witchcraft, and wit depends upon dilitary time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:32
Does it not go well?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:34
Casio, hats!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:39
But thou buy that small hercat cashier at Cassio.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:45
Some other things drove fat against us, huh?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:50
Blossom first.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:52
will first be right.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:29:54
Content thyself a while.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:01
Sorry, guys, this is if… I don't know…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:04
Behind a mess? Tis morning.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:07
Pleasure and action makes the hour seem short.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:11
Retiree, never utility.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:17
Away I say, thou shalt care more hereafter.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:21
Thank God they're gone!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:38
Two things out of me now.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:39
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress, I have set her on it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:44
I sent the wire to draw the bar apart.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:47
And 3 came up, when he made Cassio bind.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:51
Solicity? His wife.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:30:57
God, that's the way.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:00
They'll not devise by copeness and delay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:04
That was creepy. That was like devil's ears or something.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:08
All right, guys, this is when he talks to Desdemona upstage.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:15
Stay here

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:16
Final contents of pain.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:18
Something that's brief, and with good morrow, General.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:25
If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring, tell her that is one the Casio entry to a small diverse speech.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:32
without doing this? I should teach.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:35
I'm happy to have you out to me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:39
You have not been a vetted. I never be dead broke before we party. I have made both of the argument was sent in to your wife.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:46
my super heads that she will, if I chose to murder, procure me some excess. I'll send it to you pleasantly.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:51
And I divided me to draw them all out of the way.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:55
So the Jacob commerce and business may be more feat.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:31:58
Thank you for it. I never knew a Florentine more kind than honest.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:05
No! They're happening.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:06
Tomorrow, good lieutenant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:09
I am sorry for your displeasure, but all will sure go well. The General and his wife are talking of it, and she speaks for you stoutly.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:16
The law replies that he who you heard is of great famine, so I presume.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:20
Great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:25
Oh, but he protests he loves you. I need no other suit to what he's liking.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:31
To take the state sophistication by the front to bring you in again. And yet I beseech you, if you think it fits.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:37
Oh, but you'd make it dark. Give me advantage of some brief discourse for Destimona alone.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:45
Okay, coming. I will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely. I am much glad to you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:53
These letters give you up over the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:32:55
pilot to buy him do my duties to the set, that done I will be walking on the works with me. Well, I can borrow that is.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:03
This fortification, gentlemen,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:05
Come, shall we see it? Request on your lawsuit.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:08
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do all my abilities in neither hope.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:14
I know it grieves my husband as if the case for him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:16
So that's an honest fellow.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:17
Do not doubt, Cassio. I will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were. But yes, madam, whatever shall become of Michael Cassio. He's never anything but your truth.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:28
Sir, I can't.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:31
You do love, my lord.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:32
You have known him long.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:35
And be you weather assured, he shall in strangeness stand no farther up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:43
often in a politic district.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:44
But today, that policy may either last so long,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:33:48
I'll feed upon such nights and waterish dire, nor feed itself so out of circumstance, that I, being absent my place supplied, my gembra will forget my love and service. Do not doubt that people are really here, I give thee want. Thy place.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:02
Surely, if I devour friendship, I'll perform it to last article.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:07
My Lord shall never rest.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:10
I watched him came and talk him out of patience.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:14
I'll intermingle everything he does.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:20
With Cassius Hume.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:22
Therefore, be merry, Cassarot.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:25
For thy solicitation shall rather die than give thy bosom.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:28
Man, here comes my lord.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:30
And I say, and can we speak? Madam.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:33
Well, to your discretion.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:40
Ah, I like not that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:46
But it's such a thing?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:55
Was that not Cassio parted from my point?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:34:58
Catsio Vallejo?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:00
No, sure, I cannot think it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:02
that he would sneak away so guilty night seeing you coming?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:10
I do believe it was him. Oh, now, my lord.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:13
I have been talking with a suitor here.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:18
A man that languishes in your displeasure literally.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:21
Where your Lieutenant cast you?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:23
Good, my lord, if I have any grace or power to remove you, his present recon…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:30
deletion take.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:31
For if he be not one that truly loves you,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:35
But I think ignorance are not incoming, I have no judgment in an honest face.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:42
I pretty calling back. When do you have snow? I soothed so humbled he had left heart of his grief with me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:47
I suffer with him. Good luck called him back. Not now, the sweetest.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:35:53
Should be tonight, at some? No, not tonight. Tomorrow dinner. And I shall not dine at home. I meet the captains at the city.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:05
By then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning. On Tuesday morning, or night, or Wednesday morning, I've pretty late in the time, but let it not exceed 3 days.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:15
Which…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:17
shall become me, in fact.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:19
I wonder in my soul what you would ask of me that I should deny or stand so mmembering often.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:26
What Michael Cassia.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:28
But came over with you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:30
And many a time, when I have spoke of you dispraisingly had claimed your part to have so much to do to bring him in by Our Lady, I could too much. Oh, really, no more. Let him come when he will, I will deny thee, nothing. Why, this is not a boom.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:45
Jesus, I should entree to where your balance, or…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:48
Feed our nourishing dishes, or keep your wounds.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:51
What's due to you to do a peculiar profit to your own porth?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:36:55
Yay. When I have a shooter in Irene to touch your love indeed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:00
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight, and fearful to be granted. I will deny thee nothing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:07
Whereas I do appreciate you grant me this, to leave me but a little to myself. Well, shall I deny you?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:18
How lovely. Very well, my testimony will come to this rate.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:25
What dare you be interviewed?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:35
Excellent, Reggie.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:39
But I didn't catch my soul.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:42
But I do love to live.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:44
When I love thee not?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:48
Chaos is coming ahead.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:53
I never lost.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:37:59
What? What thus thou say your votes?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:04
Michael Katzio.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:06
When you would mind, AG?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:11
He did from first to last. Why does thou ask?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:15
But for the satisfaction of my thoughts, no further harm.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:18
Why ought I thought, Dioco?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:21
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:26
And right between us very often.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:30
Indeed. Indeed. Uh, indeed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:33
Since I voted that?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:35
Is he not honest?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:41
I missed. I don't, for all I know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:45
What dost thou think?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:49
pink man? Pink bundle?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:52
He echoes me as if there was a monster in his thoughts too hideous to be shown.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:38:57
Thou dost mean something.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:00
If I only say even now, thou, like it's not that well.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:03
Cass, you'll lift my wife? What kids don't like?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:07
And when I told thee he was of my council in my whole course of going, thou Christ killed him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:13
And its contract and purse thy brows together as if our then had shut up in thy brain, some horrible conceit.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:21
If that is lovely, show me thy thought.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:25
My Lord, you know I don't… I think thou.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:29
And for I know, I was full of love and honesty and waste thy words before thou givest them.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:35
whatever these stops are buying.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:39
brightly the moment. For such things in a false, disloyal knave are tricks of custom.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:45
But in a man that's just dead,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:47
Most developments working from the heart that fashion cannot hold.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:51
For Michael Cassie right there, this woman. I think 30 years honest.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:56
I think so, please. Venture B, that they see.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:39:59
How did they be not to what they had might seem now?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:05
said that men should breathe.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:07
But then I think Cassio is a bombast man.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:15
It's more in the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:19
Absolutely. Speak to me as to thy thinking.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:23
As thou dost rule it, and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:28
I know it, pardon.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:30
Though I am bound to every act of duty, I have part of that old slave's armiesome.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:35
Not to my thoughts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:38
and false.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:40
As well as that palace wearing too far being sometimes intrude now. Let us conspire against thy friend Yorgo if thou but think'st him wrong doth mixed his ear a stranger to that thought.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:52
vicious him, I guess.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:40:55
As I confess, it is my nature's plague to spy into abuses and not spy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:01
Jetus, his ship's falls for done.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:04
I introduced you that from others so it perfectly conjects, you'll take no notice.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:08
Offert yourself a trouble out of my scatric and unsure of service.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:13
It will not feel your quiet, nor your good.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:16
Nor for my man, but almost your wisdom to let you know of my fault.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:23
What does that mean?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:31
Good to name.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:33
man and woman, dear my lord.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:35
It's the immediate…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:38
Jewel of us, so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:41
Who steals my purse, steals trash?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:44
To something nothing was mind, it says, and has been saved to thousands, but he that filters for me my good name.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:41:51
Perhaps me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:03
By heaven, I know thy dog.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:05
Canada, my heart, but in your hair. Whilst it in my custody?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:11
where my daughter jealousy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:16
It is a green-eyed monster which that monk and that meat it feeds on.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:21
that Coco lives in bliss, who, certain of his fate, loves noted.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:29
chocolate. But oh, what David Letters tell thee all who doops here to dance?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:36
suspects, yet stronger loves.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:41
Polar and content is rich and rich enough, but rich is pineless.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:45
It's as porous winter to him that ever fears he shall be bored.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:49
All my tribe defend from jealousy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:42:58
Why? Why is this?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:01
Peace, though I need a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the movement which fresh suspicions, no.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:07
If it was inducted, it wants to be in its own.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:11
exchange me for a boat, for NYSOT and the business of my soul to such exogate and blown surmise matching my influence.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:18
Not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:22
large company, it's free of speech,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:24
Things plays and dances well where virtue is. These are more virtuous.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:29
know from my own weak, but it's what I draw the smallest fear or doubt the hurdled, for she had eyes!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:34
And children's meat.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:37
I see before I dug.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:39
And when I ducked?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:44
Run the proof.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:45
Let us know more about this. Away at once with love or jealousy. I am glad of it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:51
But now I shall have reason to show the love and duty that I pay with frank a spirit.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:56
That ball.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:43:59
I speak not yet to approve.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:04
Look to your wife.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:07
Observe her well with Cassia.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:09
For your eye thus not jealous, nor secure.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:11
I would not have your free and noble nature out of self-bounty be abused.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:17
Look to it, I know our country disposition well.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:21
In Vanish, they do let God see the pranks, they dare not show their husband.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:26
Their best conscience is not to leave it on death.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:28
But to keep it unknown.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:32
So, she did deceive her father married you, and when she seemed to shake and wear your look, she loved her most. To seal her father's eyes are close as a…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:44
He talked to us witchcraft.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:47
But I have much to blame, I humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:53
Bounty forever.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:44:56
I see this as a little dash to your spirits.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:01
not to jump.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:02
Not for John.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:06
In fact, I put a test?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:07
I hope you will consider what he spoke comes from my love.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:13
But I do see you, Apo. I am to pray you not to stray my speech to closer issues, not a larger reach than to suspicion.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:22
Number two, too, sir, my lord, my speech would fall into such vile success.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:27
As my thoughts ain't not that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:30
Catsio is my trusted friend.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:43
My lord, I see you are moved.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:49
Much moved.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:45:51
I do not think but testimonas of young leopards have a long-lived you to think, sir.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:09
um… nature?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:12
from it, so… Hi, there's the point! As to be told with you, not to affect many proposed matches of her own kind, complexion, and degree. What do we see in all things Nature 10?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:24
By one may smell and such?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:27
A will most wreck.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:29
How disproportion.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:32
thoughts are natural, but part of me, I do not imposition distinctly speak of her, though I may fear her will.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:40
Recording to a better judgment, they fall to match you with her country forms and happily repented.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:48
It's more as I just perceived.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:50
lets me know more. Set on thy wife to observe.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:46:58
I don't take money.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:15
Why did I marry?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:20
this honest creature Douglas sees and knows more.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:24
much more than he unfolds. My noble lord.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:29
I would, I might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:33
Leave it to time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:35
Though it befit that Cassio have his place, for sure, he fills it up with great ability. If you please, to hold him off a while, you shall buy that, perceive him, and his…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:48
8. Note, if your lady strain his entertainment within his strong or vehement importunity.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:53
Much will be seen in that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:47:55
And in the meantime. That's maybe thought too busy in my fears, as well, the cause I have too fear I am.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:02
And hold her free, I do beseech your honor. I once more take money.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:13
struggles of exceeding honesty.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:20
All right, we can stop there, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:24
It's where the learned spirit of human dealing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:31
If I…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:37
pack up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:40
just says when my dear hearts swings, I…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:47
let her down the wind to pray

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:48:56
All right, we'll stop.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:49:00
Hi. For I am black.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:49:04
I have not those soft parts of conversation that…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:49:08
Chain Bottas have.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:49:20
Well, very powerful stuff, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:49:32
What do you think? What do you feel?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:49:47
What are your thoughts, guys? How do you feel for you about Iago? How do you feel about Othello?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:50:35
Can you folks hear me?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:50:40
Okay, good, Jonathan, thank you. So, how do you guys feel about…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:50:46
Iago starting to plant his…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:50:50
C.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:50:58
You could see how Othello is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:02
beginning to just unravel.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:05
be completely defeated. I mean, you can see the spirit and the life

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:12
just starting to drain out of him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:17
It's very sad, because…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:20
what you know of Othello, we had this conversation earlier,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:25
His whole life was no peace.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:30
Always fighting, always in conflict.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:32
Always in fight-or-flight mode.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:34
The only piece he has is with Desdemona, and Othello just… and Iago is destroying that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:42
So you can see…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:44
how Othello's mental state is

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:48
starting to unravel.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:51
He's starting to lose his sanity, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:51:57
You can see it on his face, you can start to see it in his actions. He's going mad,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:02
He's going insane, he's turning it into an unstoppable animal.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:08
And Iago is just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:10
taking joy in all of it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:12
so sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:15
Um,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:17
that's how I feel. That's my catharsis. I could've… I could have…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:21
I felt tears in my eyes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:26
When he looks to the heavens, and he quietly says, oh, God, why did I marry?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:32
Like, what did I do wrong?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:34
deserve this. So you see the life coming out of them. It's being sucked out of him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:42
By the seeds that Iago has planted. It's very, very sad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:46
And the scene, Act 3, Scene 3, continues on.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:51
And then, of course,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:54
he has a stroke and seizures, and he's… it's just too much for him to handle.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:52:59
Um, but you saw him, I hope, grab the crucifix, right? And we had that conversation

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:06
Before, that when he feels stressed,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:09
or scared.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:11
He holds his crucifix and looks up to the heaven as if he's saying, God, please help me survive this.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:17
Because that's important to notice, because you will see

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:21
The definitive moment coming up…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:24
You'll see it next week, when he…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:28
abandons God, abandons his belief.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:32
in doing the right thing. He rips off his crucifix,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:35
throws it against the room, and you know he's turned evil.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:40
He doesn't care. He just wants…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:45
Casio dead, and he wants to kill Desdemona. That's it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:50
You'll see that next Saturday. Guys, so the module you have to do for me for next week is an essay

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:53:57
how and why our animal and plant metaphors used

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:03
In Othello, by Iago, and other characters.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:08
All right?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:54:11
So, uh, for the essay, do we have to make reference on…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:54:17
Uh, scene…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:17
Yeah, and that… yeah, and that's why I provided you guys and told you where you can find

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:54:20
Okay, all right.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:54:22
Yeah, yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:23
All the animal metaphors, all the plant metaphors,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:27
So I told you exactly where to look for them, right? Act 1, Scene 1…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:33
Act 2, Act 3, and even in Act 4 and 5, even if we didn't get to it yet. Remember, Amelia says she's the swan.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:41
This beautiful, delicate,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:44
white, delicate, harmless animal, right? And then Desimona is referred to as a white ewe!

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:52
A gentle little lamb, and what do they call Othello? The black ram.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:54:58
you know, uh, barbering Horse.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:02
Um, et cetera, et cetera.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:04
Um, if you need… if you have other further questions, um, on that module, just send me a text or send me an email.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:13
Uh, but you should be good with what we covered today, and I will post that module in, like, the next 5 minutes, okay? I'm gonna do it now, as soon as we log off.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:21
We covered a lot today, guys. A lot. Just going through the animal and plant metaphors,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:27
is enough for the day, right? But we also started into Act 3.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:33
Where you see…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:36
the devious of Iago's plan…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:40
And planting that seed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:43
has taken off. And just like a wild weed,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:47
Weeds in the garden, if they're not…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:52
Hold and taken away, and cultivated. What happens?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:55
The weeds grow out of control.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:55:58
See? That's what's about to happen, this lie…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:01
it spreads, and it spreads, and then it gets out of control, and nature takes over.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:07
Nobody's even following the rules and laws of society.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:11
And it's about to get…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:13
worse. So that's it, guys. Um, welcome to the world of Othello and Iago.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:56:19
So, Professor, I was gonna ask you something? So, we have around 4 more classes,

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:56:24
to finish the semester, correct?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:27
Yeah, this is 12 weeks, yep.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:56:29
Okay, so are we… so next week, we're going to continue with Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:34
As soon as we finish off Fellow, we should finish it next Saturday. I will give you guys a study guide, and then you'll take the exam.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:43
Which is going to be based on

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:46
Aristotle's six elements,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:49
Um, catharsis,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:52
Uh… self-recognition, those terms we covered.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:56:56
Um, and then I will probably add method acting and some playwriting techniques, and then you guys will take the final.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:57:03
So, okay, so that's…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:57:06
on Saturday 15, you're gonna give us that, and do we do the test right away? Is it due on, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:12
No, I'm gonna give you a study guide, and then you do it, um, we'll do it on a Saturday during class time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:18
It'll be like a module that you just open, and you type in the answers. It'll be open…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:57:24
Oh, okay, okay. So, it'll be on the 22nd.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:25
Yeah, it'll be during class time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:27
Yeah, and it will be, um…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:57:33
The Saturday after?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:33
It won't be… yeah, it won't be this Saturday. Next Saturday.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:38
Next Saturday, we will finish Othello. I will give you the study guide.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:43
Um, and then it'll either be the following Saturday or the Saturday after.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:57:48
Okay, so it'll be on the 22, because on the 29th, we don't have class, because it's Thanksgiving.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:52
Right. Thanksgiving break, yeah.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:57:56
Okay, and after that,

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:57:57
That's a fine note? No.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:57:59
Well, we have to see how you guys do on the study guide, like, you know, what…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:04
how much time we spend on reviewing everything. When you guys tell me, yeah, we're ready to do it,

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:58:11
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:11
Yeah, but it's very straightforward. You know Aristotle's six elements, you know

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:58:13
that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:17
Self-recognition and catharsis. And then it'll be questions like, um,

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:21
you know, why… how does…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:25
Othello die in the end, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:27
you know, um, why is Brabantio so angry in Act 1? Things like that, so I can…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:34
gauge your level of, um, comprehension, okay?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 11:58:40
Okay

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:41
Any other questions? Guys, make sure your module's in.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:46
1, 2, 3, and 4.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:47
And five, I'm gonna get put in there right now for next week.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:58:51
Okay? That's the plant and animal metaphor, the essay. But make sure you're on top of getting your modules completed and submitted. Some of you have missed

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:01
Submitting any modules, so you get zero.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:03
It's not good. It's going to affect your grade, all right? So that's your responsibility to get your modules completed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:10
on time, so you get all 20 points.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:13
Any other questions?

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:17
Very good, guys. Thank you for all who read their, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:21
Act 1 Othello Analysis. I appreciate it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:25
And you guys are doing really, really good with handling Othello, because this is not an easy play. It's really intense.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:32
The themes are really intense.

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:34
And you guys are great, so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 11:59:36
Have fun, good luck with the plant and animal metaphor, and we'll think… should… yeah, we'll finish Othello next Saturday, okay?

[Daniel Herzog] 11:59:44
Okay, thank you, Professor
