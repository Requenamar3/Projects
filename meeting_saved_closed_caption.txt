[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:57
Hi, everybody, good evening.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:00
Um, sorry about Chapter 10 posting the lecture. What I think I'm gonna do is cut it down to two different videos, so it's smaller.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:10
And hopefully that will, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:14
Upload, sorry for the delay, it's just been giving me, like, a lot of issues. Um, but I'll try to do that after.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:20
After class today. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:24
Let me pull up…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:29
DNA biology.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:30
Okay, so this is the last chapter before your next exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:35
So, your exam is next Thursday.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:37
And it's gonna cover chapters 8,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:41
10, and 11.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:42
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:44
Yeah, and then we're gonna be on the last part of the class, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:49
We're moving right along, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:53
Anyone have any questions before we start?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:57
No? Okay.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:43:58
So we have two more classes after… after today.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:44:02
Two more… two more classes, and then…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:44:04
That's it. The test, the third test, the fourth…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:44:08
Test, and that's it. Wow.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:09
Exactly. So we just have… let me just pull up the syllabus really quick so everyone can see.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:17
We're all on the same page.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:24
Okay, can you guys see the syllabus?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:27
Okay, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:31
Here we are, um, Thursday the 6th, so we have DNA Biology, Chapter 11.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:37
And then you have your exam next Thursday, chapter… or, excuse me, Exam 3.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:43
And then we have the lecture on Chapter 14 on evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:48
And then it's Thanksgiving, so no class, obviously.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:51
And then December 4th, you have the last chapter, chapter 31. So yes, two more lectures after today.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:59
And then, of course, you don't come to class for the exam date, so after I lecture on Chapter 31, you guys will take the exam the next

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:09
Um, you know, in the next week?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:12
And then that's it. So, a couple reminders, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:19
The…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:21
Um, so with a couple more chapters to go, that means you only have, like, 3 more homework assignments.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:28
So make sure that you try your best on all of these, and you do both attempts.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:32
And, uh, you try to get the best grade possible.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:36
Um, I will say that there is another assignment that's called the Writing Reflection Activity that's gonna be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:43
do the day of the exam by 12 p.m. or by noon. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:48
That is going to be open pretty early for you. I'm gonna give you, like, a couple weeks to do that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:54
For a few weeks to do that. So, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:57
that is an easy A if you answer all of the questions, there's only a few questions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:02
And if you answer them, you know, in complete sentences, I think it's, like, 3 sentences per question. If you answer, uh, the questions

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:10
Uh, honestly, and you don't use any form of AI or other people, ChatGPT, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:17
Google, et cetera, as long as you don't look up anything.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:20
Um, there's nothing to look up, and there's nothing… it's just open-ended questions, like, what was your favorite part of the class, and like, what chapter did you struggle with the most? Which one did you like the most? Just be honest, it's like a feedback question, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:33
your feedback assignment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:35
But you don't need help writing in ChatGPT, you're not going to be graded on spelling, or grammar or anything like that, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:41
Anyway, that's an easy A, 100% activity, um, and then…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:47
That's gonna be the last four.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:49
assignments in the gradebook.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:51
And then I'm gonna catch up on…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:54
attendance, um, after this class, hopefully, so by next week, everything should be updated, or at least by Thanksgiving.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:01
And that can help you, you know, better determine your grade, too.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:04
Okay? Everyone good on the schedule? Does that make sense?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:47:11
Yes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:11
Yeah? Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:15
So, let me start…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:19
Recording… if this thing will work…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:25
Okay, did you get the notification that it started working?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:30
We started recording?

[Lilian Valencia] 17:47:32
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:32
Sweet. Okay, Chapter 11, DNA Biology. We're gonna first go into DNA and RNA structure and function.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:41
So, we briefly reviewed DNA, um, in past chapters, but we're gonna talk more about it in depth in this chapter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:48
And we're going to look at the four characteristics that DNA has. So, number one, DNA has variability.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:56
Um, and it has this variability, basically, to account for the differences that are involved in life. So, variability in species, of what makes, you know, a human a human, what makes a tiger a tiger.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:10
Uh, it's the differences between sharks and plants and mushrooms and people and all of these things. So DNA can be very variable,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:19
and produce a lot of variability in the genome, or in the, you know, the genes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:26
Um, to create different forms of life.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:31
DNA also has the ability to replicate. This is where every cell gets a copy of the DNA during cell division. We talked a lot about that in the last chapter… no, in Chapter 8.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:45
And then, DNA also stores information. Um, we know that DNA is kind of like the blueprint for life, um, in what

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:54
Um, the functions and the structure of organisms look like, um, how they're going to behave, how they're going to act, how they're going to look.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:03
And it also stores information

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:05
I needed to control the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:08
So, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:11
Yeah, DNA is basically the brain behind, um, all the cells and their activities.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:18
And lastly, DNA has the ability to change or to mutate. Um, we know that if

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:24
Um, the DNA mutation is a bad mutation. Um, we know that that can cause diseases like cancer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:32
But DNA can also change or mutate in a more positive way, in that it can allow for the evolution of new species. So, it's not always a bad mutation that can happen, but it can

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:44
be a shift in the genome, or a switch, um, that is not, you know, detrimental to

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:51
the cell into the organism.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:54
And as a reminder, this is what DNA looks like. It is the double helix structure here on the right. Um, it has two…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:03
uh, ribbons, basically, that are the backbone.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:05
Um, that meet… that are made of the sugar and the phosphate groups.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:09
And then you have the nitrogen-containing bases in the middle of them that are connecting the two strands of DNA together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:16
And reminder, this is how they pair, guanine and cytosine pair together, and adenine and thymine pair together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:27
So we're gonna look at some of the scientists that looked at the structure and function of DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:36
And helped to discover, um, what DNA really looked like.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:41
So we have Erwin Charkov, we have Rosalind Franklin, and we have Watson and Crick.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:48
So, um, for the exam, you'll have to know generally each of these.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:53
uh, three groups of people, and what they did, and what their contribution was.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:58
Oops, and what their contribution was to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:01
um… DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:06
I'm just responding to a chat…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:12
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:25
Okay, so first off, Erwin Charghoff, he came up with his rules. So, Chargov's rules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:34
Um, to start, we know that the amount of adenine, thymine,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:40
Cytosine and guanine, those are the four DNA nucleotides, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:44
The amounts of those in the DNA varies from species to species. So this is one of the variability things.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:52
Um, the amount of these nucleotides vary

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:56
in humans, and they vary in sharks, they vary in trees, they vary in…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:01
you know, fish, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:03
They're different amounts.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:05
Um, but in each species,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:08
the amount of adenine and thymine,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:11
are equal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:13
So, A, the amount of A is always going to equal the amount of T.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:17
And the amount of cytosine…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:19
is always going to equal the amount of guanine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:22
This is easy to remember because they pair like this, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:26
ATCG, at Coconut Grove, A-T-C-G. That's one way to remember it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:32
So, Tarkov's rules, I want you to think about percentages, or the amounts.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:37
Okay? So, adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:42
These are the four, um, nucleotides. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:46
On the exam, I could ask you a question like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:52
Let me draw it here…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:55
This is a hundred…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:59
Okay, so if I said…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:02
There is 20%

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:07
of adenine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:08
Would you be able to tell me the other three?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:12
percentages of the other three nucleotides? What do you guys think?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:53:15
Yeah, yes?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:17
Yeah, right? So, what we can do is we know adenine is 20%.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:53:18
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:22
And based on Chargov's rule,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:24
Adenine is going to equal the amount of thymine.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:53:28
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:28
And we know that immediately, thymine is going to be 20.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:53:33
Yep.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:33
So now we have cytosine and guanine left, and we know that those two equal each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:38
So what we're gonna do is we know this is 100%,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:41
We're gonna add up the 220s, so 20 plus 20 is 40.

[Juan Santos] 17:53:45
30, 30, 6, 3…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:47
And we're going…

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:53:47
Perry on Perry.

[Juan Santos] 17:53:48
30-turty.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:53:49
33, yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:49
Sorry, can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:51
Oh, okay, got it, got it. Yeah, you guys are jumping ahead, you're so smart. Wait for it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:57
100 minus 40?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:59
is 60, and then we're gonna do 60 divided by 2, divided by the cytosine and guanine, so yes, it's going to be 30 and 30.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:06
Exactly. Okay? So, I might ask you a question like that on the exam, and it's pretty simple math, as long as you remember that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:14
all four of these equal 100, you can, you know, figure out the rest of them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:19
Okay?

[Lilian Valencia] 17:54:21
So, I'm sorry, so you're gonna… I'm sorry, so you're gonna give us one percentage.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:22
Okay, so…

[Lilian Valencia] 17:54:26
And then we will figure it out. Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:26
Mm-hmm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:28
Exactly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:31
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:35
Now we're gonna look at Rosalind Franklin, her contribution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:38
She helped to determine that DNA was in this, um, double helix, or this X kind of shape.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:45
But she looked at the structure of DNA, or the shape of it,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:49
using something called X-ray crystallography.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:52
So, X-ray crystallography is basically when a crystal is X-rayed,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:59
And the x-ray beam, or, like, the laser, or the light, you can think about it, is diffracted or deflected,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:07
onto a, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:08
like a whiteboard, basically, or like a projector screen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:12
And the results on the projector screen show how the atoms are arranged in that crystal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:19
So, everyone look over here at the top right.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:23
Here is the X-ray beam. It comes from a box.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:27
And here we have the beam shooting out into this crystal. So this is a crystal, and what she did was she created crystalline DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:35
So she took DNA, and she, um, created crystals from it, so it's pure DNA, it's just turned crystallized.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:44
into a hard crystal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:46
And that x-ray beam

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:49
is shot into this crystal, and it is projected

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:53
the, um, the pattern of the atoms, or the pattern of the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:57
you know, the DNA itself.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:59
So that diffraction pattern, this is the pictures that she saw, she was able to see that it had a double helix shape.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:08
Okay, so that's kind of that X…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:11
kind of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:14
image that we look at.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:16
Okay? So, when you think of Rosalind Franklin, you want to think of X-ray crystallography. Remember, she's using a crystal, crystalline DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:25
And she's shooting an X-ray through it, and whatever the diffraction pattern was.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:30
She found that it was that X kind of double helix shape.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:40
That was her contribution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:44
Lastly,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:46
We have Watson and Crick.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:49
And what they did was they created a model of DNA, a physical model made of tin and wire. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:57
I guess in the picture that I showed back here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:01
This was their model.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:03
So this was their physical model of DNA, made of tin and wire.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:08
So, what they found was that the two strands of DNA

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:12
We're running anti-parallel.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:15
Or they were running in separate or opposite directions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:20
So if you guys look at the backbone here, you see this… how the phosphate group, the P, is straight and upright.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:27
And then on this side, it's the opposite.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:30
Right? So, think about it like a road.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:34
One, um, strand is running in one direction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:37
And the other strand is running towards you in the other direction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:41
So that's what anti-parallel means. It's an opposite directions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:46
Um, they were able to figure this out because of this double helix structure. If you were to just have it, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:56
um… running in parallel, running in the same direction,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:00
then DNA would be more like a ladder. It wouldn't really be 3D, it would just kind of be flat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:05
So, the fact that you can have it in opposite directions allows for that twist to happen, and allows for that, um, compaction to happen, so it can fit better into

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:15
the nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:18
So, they also found out, or not found out, but kind of named how one side has a 5' end, and the other has a 3' end. So this little apostrophe here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:31
Everyone sees this little apostrophe.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:33
That means prime, when you're talking about DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:36
So, 5' end and a 3' end. So, this end over here, with the OH- sticking out,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:44
Oh, I guess we'll start over here, sorry. The 5' end over here has a free phosphate group sticking out,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:51
Over here, so that they called the 5' end.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:54
And the 3' end over here has a free OH- group, or a hydroxide group sticking out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:02
Um, I'm sure there's a specific reason why they called it 5' and 3', I don't know it, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:08
Um, that's how they… they were able to determine this based on the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:14
the DNA being anti-parallel.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:17
So when you think of Watson and Crick, I want you to think of that model wire, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:23
the wire model that they built.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:25
And think about how…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:31
It'd have that 3D shape.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:32
And that there was a 5' end.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:36
and a 3' end, again, with that… going along with that anti-parallel.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:42
um… beam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:43
If you will.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:47
Okay, so those were the three there. Um, one thing I want to note on this image,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:53
is… does anyone tell me? It says it here, but what type of bond is connecting the nucleotides together?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:00
You see these little dots? What kind of bond is it?

[Katerina Torre] 18:00:05
Hyd

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:07
Yeah, it's a hydrogen bond.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:09
So this will be important for, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:14
DNA replication, which we'll talk about later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:18
Or we can talk about it now. DNA replication.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:22
Um, so DNA replication, we've talked about this, um, when we talked about the cell cycle, we know that it happens

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:30
in the S phase of the cell cycle, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:32
the S phase of interphase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:35
Right? So, um, we know that DNA replication, it basically creates an identical copy of the DNA molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:44
ready to give to the next…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:47
So, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:49
So, the two strands of DNA, like I just mentioned, are held together by the hydrogen bonds.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:55
Um, they are connected by the, uh,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:59
the nitrogenous bases.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:01
And, um, their hydrogen bond connected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:05
There is this, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:08
special molecule called helicase that breaks down those hydrogen bonds

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:13
And helps to unzip or unwind that double helix.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:17
when we're getting ready to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:19
replicate that DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:21
I have a question. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:25
helicase, or any other word with the ending A-S-E.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:30
what type of molecule do you think that is?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:33
I don't know if I've told you guys this already.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:36
But if anyone could guess, for an extra credit point on the next exam, without looking it up,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:42
What do you guys think?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:45
the molecule with the ASE.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:48
At the end means. Don't look it up.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:51
Just think about it. It's… I'll give you a hint. It's a… it's a type of one of the four biological molecules. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:00
Nucleic acid, protein, lipid, carbohydrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:03
it's a subcategory in one of those.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:07
I don't know if that's specific enough, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:13
Yeah, that was kind of vague. Okay, protein. It's a type of protein. So, within protein,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:18
what are some examples of types of proteins?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:02:21
Could be enzymo and Zima?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:23
enzymes, yeah, enzymes.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:02:24
Ansema? And that, that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:26
Awesome. Was that Lillian? Okay.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:02:27
that.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:02:29
Yes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:29
I'll put an extra credit point for you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:32
enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:35
So, yes.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:02:35
Sometimes I don't like to answer because the pronunciation with this, uh, this, it's, it's… nuh-uh.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:42
It's hard, don't worry. It's not you, it's difficult.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:46
Um, Lillian, extra credit. Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:50
So, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:52
Oh, speaking of extra credit, reminder, um, your extra credit for the healthy eating, remember you guys have to submit that

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:00
Um, by 5PM of next Thursday.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:03
Before the exam, okay? And that will give you… you have to give me 3 photos or videos, you can put your name on a sheet of paper with the food item in your meal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:13
Um, and they have to be from different meals.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:15
But you can send me 3 of them worth 2 points each, so that's 6 points.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:20
Um, 6 points on your exam is basically, like, 12%, so it's a whole letter grade plus a little bit more.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:27
Okay, so it's really important if you guys want to do well in my class, and try to improve your grade,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:33
Um, that you take advantage of my extra credit opportunities, and this is a big one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:37
So, um, anyway, just wanted to mention that again.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:42
Okay, back to DNA replication. So, um, helicase is an enzyme, yes, that is breaking those hydrogen bonds and unwinding the double helix strands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:52
Um, I'm gonna show you guys visuals of this so it'll make it easier, but just to give you kind of the breakdown of it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:57
Then we have DNA polymerase, which, again, is another enzyme that helps to add new daughter strands to the parent strand by adding those complementary nucleotides. So basically, we have the DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:11
uh, strand, it's getting broken apart into two different strands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:17
by helicase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:18
And then we have DNA polymerase that's coming to add on the new complementary nucleotides onto both of those strands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:27
So now we're gonna end up with two whole different strands of DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:31
So, technically, 4 strands total.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:35
But two molecules of DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:37
Okay, because again, we're replicating it, right? We're trying to duplicate it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:43
Um, yeah, so helicase and DNA polymerase, those are some big players.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:51
In eukaryotes, DNA replication can happen at numerous sites. So, if you're looking at… we're trying to go through the whole DNA of an organism, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:01
So, if you just start at one end of the DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:04
That's gonna take a long time to get

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:07
all the way through the line to get to the very end of the DNA, right? So, in eukaryotes, this happens at numerous sites.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:15
And these sites are called Origins of Replication.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:18
So they're kind of like bubbles. So think about a really long strand of DNA, it has the two strands, right? Or a long molecule of DNA, it has the two strands, or the two ribbons,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:28
And think about them breaking apart.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:32
at multiple locations with that Gila case splitting.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:35
those two. Think about it like a zipper. It's like multiple places in the zipper, you're unzipping it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:40
Okay, those are origins of replication.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:43
at each origin of replication, something called a replication fork forms. So that's that bubble that I was saying. So basically, it's just the helicase

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:53
spreading apart that, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:57
spreading apart that zipper or that DNA molecule to create those two…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:02
you know, template strands to have the new nucleotides put on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:09
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:11
Yeah, and then within that bubble, DNA replication happens throughout, um, both of the strands in opposite directions, because DNA runs in opposite directions, it's going to be replicated in opposite directions as well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:24
Um, until the whole thing is copied. So, I know this was vague, but I just wanted to put it into words to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:31
make sense of it, and then I'll show you a, um, image, and then also, I think, a video.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:36
to, um, solidify it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:38
So, lastly, another enzyme called DNA ligase comes in and seals any of the breaks in the backbone, so it kind of comes up and seals everything up, glues it all together,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:50
To make sure that…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:52
everything is all…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:54
zip together, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:58
So, here it… yes, Antonella.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:07:02
Sorry, I'm just a little confused, and I wanted, I guess, like, a refresher, um, because I keep getting chromosomes and DNA

[Antonella Diaz] 18:07:10
mixed up. So, in order to make a chromosome, that strand around the histones is the DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:15
Correct, yes.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:07:16
And then the DNA also has two separate strands, so it's like two strands. It's like a bunch of strands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:21
Exactly. So that strand, that's wrapped… the DNA that's wrapping around the histones, think of it like a bracelet thing with two…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:31
two ropes, or two lines.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:33
So it's the two strands of DNA that are wrapping around those histones that then get condensed to form a chromosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:41
Make sense?

[Antonella Diaz] 18:07:42
Yeah, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:44
Cool, no problem.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:46
So, here is kind of the process of DNA replication. Um, don't…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:51
you know, let this stress you out, we're gonna walk through it together, and you're gonna see that it makes

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:56
Hopefully makes sense, um, the more that you look at it and the more that you go through it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:02
So let's start over here on the right. Um, these blue strands, this double-stranded helix, right, this double helix,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:09
is the parent DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:12
Okay, so it's the original strand of the DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:14
So what we want to do is break this into the individual strands, and then put the new strand

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:21
of DNA onto the old one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:24
So what we're going to do first is have helicase, which is this enzyme that's going to

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:30
unzip those, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:32
unzip the DNA and break those hydrogen bonds so it splits into a replication fork.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:39
Okay? So, let's start over here on the leading strand. So there's the leading strand, which is on top, and then there's the lagging strand, which is on the left over here, near the bottom.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:52
So, if you look at the arrows really quick, do you guys see this green arrow here? And you guys see these green arrows here?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:00
You see how they're going in separate directions?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:03
It has to go in separate directions because the DNA is running anti-parallel to each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:08
So, because the DNA is running in opposite directions, it has to be replicated in opposite directions. That's what I was saying earlier.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:17
So, looking at this leading strand here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:20
We have the blue strand is the template strand, or the half of the parent strand, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:27
And then the green is the new strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:29
So, this enzyme here, this big one, DNA polymerase,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:33
is going to just by itself,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:36
add the green strand onto the blue strand. And what it does is it basically matches the nucleotides.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:43
So on the parent strand, if it's A, C, G,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:48
What would the, um, the new strand be? Someone tell me. If the parent strand, the code reads A, C, G, what would the other side say?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:04
Remember how they pair together? Adenine, cytosine, guanine, ACG, so what would the other side be?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:10:10
That's T?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:10:11
the T?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:13
T-thymine, yep, that's the first one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:17
CG, so what's the opposite of that? GC.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:10:21
GC, yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:21
Right? Mm-hmm. So, adenine, cytosine, guanine then becomes thymine, guanine, cytosine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:30
So, that's the new strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:32
of the code on the other side that is being

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:35
attached to the parent strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:38
Because it's the complementary strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:41
Was it the complementary nucleotide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:43
So that's what DNA polymerase does.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:45
That's on the leading strand. That's all it does. DNA polymerase just adds the complementary code

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:51
to the parent strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:54
Now, on the lagging strand…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:57
Um… it's a little bit more complex, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:02
We still have a template strand in blue, that's the original half of the parental DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:08
And then this new strand, the lat… which is called the lagging strand,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:14
Um, is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:17
um, added…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:19
by something called Okazaki fragments.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:23
Okay? And a fragment is basically like a chunk

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:27
of code, or a chunk of nucleotides that match…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:31
with, or complementary with,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:34
the parent strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:36
So you can think of each one of these lines here, you guys see these little square, or these little rectangles?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:42
You can think of each of these as the coat, as the nucleotides.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:47
So, an Okazaki fragment

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:49
It was named after the guy who figured them out, Okazaki. Um, he was a scientist that figured out that

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:55
these fragments were added on this way.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:57
So, the fragments are added, and DNA ligase…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:01
comes and zips up.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:04
the edges of the backbone.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:07
basically connects the fragments together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:10
And then, that's happening on…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:13
Um, one part of the lagging strand, and then the other part is also having DNA polymerase, which does the same thing as the leading strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:23
in adding the complementary…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:28
um, you know, strand onto the parent strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:31
Okay? So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:35
keep looking at this, don't get too confused by it, um, you don't have to memorize this figure, I'm not gonna make you memorize it, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:42
It is a good summary of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:45
you know, DNA replication, it's a good visual.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:49
Um, but remember that on the leading strand, you have just DNA polymerase adding on those nucleotides, the complementary nucleotides to the parent strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:58
And then you have, on the lagging strand, two different ways to add new nucleotides. You have the Okazaki fragments,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:05
And you have the DNA polymerase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:09
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:11
Um, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:14
Another visual for this, and this whole thing is called the semi-conservative DNA model. Please write that down, I know that's an exam question.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:24
Um, the current, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:27
or DNA replication.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:29
the model that we call it is called a semi-conservative model.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:34
And it's semi-conservative because

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:36
If you look at here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:38
This is the original parent strand. It has two strands, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:42
So, the original pair…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:48
So, the new DNA has

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:51
Some of the old and some of the new.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:54
So that's why

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:55
So that's why it's semi-conservative, it's, like, half and half. It's half old, half new.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:59
Okay? There are other… there are other models that they went through that don't…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:14:00
Represent.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:04
make as much sense, but this one is the most widely accepted model. Yeah, I had a question.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:14:09
Oh, uh, I was just gonna ask you, because I lost the connection for a second,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:16
Mm-hmm.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:14:16
And it's the second time it happened, so I don't know if it's your connection or mine.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:14:21
Do you have… did anybody, uh, there was a part that it skipped.

[Clery Altamirano] 18:14:26
Yeah, it happens to me too. It happens.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:14:27
Okay, so it's on your end, Professor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:31
Uh-oh.

[Sadye Ruiz] 18:14:32
Mine

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:34
What did you guys miss? What do I need to go back?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:14:35
It was very short, it was very short.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:40
Yeah.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:14:40
I think it was when you were explaining about the DNA, uh, replication. I think that's… that's what a…

[Lilian Valencia] 18:14:49
I think that's when it kinda…

[Lilian Valencia] 18:14:50
cut off a little bit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:53
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:55
Let me go back.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:58
Um, on this slide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:02
No? Over here?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:15:04
On the next one, yes, when you were going in… yes, right in there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:06
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:08
Okay, no worries. If that happens again, just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:11
Wave your hands or something, or write it in the chat, and I'll…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:14
Try to wait and go back.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:17
Um, but this is the semi-conservative DNA model

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:20
Um, just remember that that's what it's called, because it has half of the parental strand, and it has half of the new strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:33
Okay? Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:37
Let me see how far we are.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:45
Yeah, I think it's fine. Okay, so we're gonna watch this video, um, to hopefully…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:52
give a better idea of DNA replication. It goes into more detail than

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:59
Uh, you need to know, but it's just another way to look at it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:02
And, um, give you guys another…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:06
Um, you know, just another explanation of it that might help, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:11
It is a little cartoonish, um, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:15
It is very thorough, and it's helpful in, you know, describing

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:21
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:23
DNA replication. So, it's 8 minutes, we'll just watch this, and then…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:29
Um, if you have any questions, let me know, and we'll move on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:32
Let me know, give me a thumbs up if you guys can hear it, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:39
DNA. We talk about it so much, it's the ultimate director for cells, and it codes for your traits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:45
With a molecule that has a function like that,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:47
It makes sense that when you make another cell, like in cell division, you would also need to get more DNA into the new daughter cell,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:56
And that introduces our topic of DNA replication, which means making more DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:01
First, let's talk about where and when.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:04
First, where? Well, if it's in a eukaryotic cell, it occurs in the nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:09
However, remember, not all cells have a nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:12
Such as prokaryotic cells. They don't have a nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:15
Still, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells do DNA replication.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:20
But there's some differences between the two that this clip doesn't go into.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:23
Next, when. When does this happen?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:26
Well, a cell is going to need to do this before it divides so that the new daughter cell can also get a copy of DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:32
To get specific, in a eukaryotic cell, that's going to be before mitosis or meiosis, in a time known as interphase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:40
I think DNA replication would actually make a great video game.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:44
Still waiting for that to be invented. I'm going to introduce the key players in DNA replication so that you can get some background information. Now remember, these are just

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:53
some major key players. There's a lot to this process.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:56
Many of the key players are enzymes. In biology, when you see something end in A-S-E,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:02
You might want to check, as it's very possible that it's an enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:05
Enzymes have the ability to speed up reactions and build up or break down the items that they act upon.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:12
So, here we go with the key players.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:14
Helicase, the unzipping enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:17
If you recall that DNA has two strands, you could think of helicase unzipping the two strands of DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:23
Heel case doesn't have a hard time doing that. When unzipping, it breaks through the hydrogen bonds that hold the DNA bases together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:30
DNA polymerase, the builder, this enzyme replicates DNA molecules to actually build a new strand of DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:38
Primase, the initializer. With as great as DNA polymerases, DNA polymerase can't figure out where to get started.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:45
Without something called a primer,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:47
Primase makes the primer so that DNA polymerase can figure out where to go to start to work.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:53
You know what's kind of interesting about the primer it makes?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:56
Primer is actually made of RNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:59
Ligase, the gluer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:01
It helps glue DNA fragments together. More about why you would need that later on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:06
Now, don't feel overwhelmed. We'll go through the basics of this sequence in order.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:11
But remember, like all of our videos, we tend to give the big picture. There are always more details and exceptions to every biological process that we can't include in such a short video.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:22
DNA replication starts at a certain part called the origin.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:26
Usually this part is identified by certain DNA sequences.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:31
At the origin, helicase, the unzipping enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:34
comes in and unwinds the DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:36
Here's the thing, though. You don't want these strands to come back together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:40
So, SSB proteins, which stands for single-stranded binding proteins,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:45
Bind to the DNA strands to keep them separated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:47
And topoisomerase?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:49
I always have to slow down when I say that enzyme's name.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:52
Keeps the DNA from supercoiling. Supercoiling might sound super, and it can be when you're trying to compact the DNA, but it's something that needs to be controlled during DNA replication. Supercoiling can involve an overwinding of the DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:05
And you need the DNA strands to be separated for the next steps.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:08
Primase comes in and makes RNA primers on both strands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:11
This is really important because otherwise, DNA polymerase won't know where to start.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:17
In comes DNA polymerase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:19
Okay, before we go on, remember how we said DNA has two strands?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:23
They're not identical, they complement each other. In our video that covers DNA structure, we talk about how the bases pair together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:30
With hydrogen bonds, the base adenine goes with the base thymine, and the base guanine goes with the base cytosine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:37
These strands are also anti-parallel, so they don't go in the same direction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:43
What do we mean by direction?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:45
Well, with DNA, we don't say north or south.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:48
We say DNA either goes 5' to 3',

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:51
Or, 3' to 5'.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:54
What in the world does that mean? Well, the sugar of DNA is part of the backbone of DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:59
It has carbons. The carbons and the sugar are numbered right after the oxygen, in a clockwise direction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:06
1 prime, 2', 3', 4', and 5'.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:10
The 5' carbon is actually outside of the spring structure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:13
Now, you do the same thing for the other side, but keep in mind, DNA strands are anti-parallel to each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:19
So, let's count these. Again, clockwise after the oxygen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:23
1 prime, 2', 3', 4', 5'.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:27
In the 5' is out of this ring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:29
This strand on the left runs 5' to 3'.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:32
In the strand here on the right runs 3' to 5'.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:37
Explain why all that matters in a moment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:39
So, let's take that knowledge there and look at DNA replication here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:43
In this image, I labeled the top original strand 3' to 5'.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:48
I labeled this bottom original strand 5' to 3'.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:52
That's the original DNA that is going to be replicated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:56
DNA is unwinding here thanks to helicase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:59
In this example, it will keep unwinding in this direction,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:03
Primase places primers,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:05
DNA polymerase is building the new strands. Now, the thing about DNA polymerase is, when it's building a new strand, it can only build the new strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:14
In the 5' to 3' direction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:17
Meaning, it adds new bases to the 3' end on the new strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:21
See how it's being built in the 5' to 3' direction?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:25
This one is called the leading strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:28
But take a look down here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:30
So, DNA polymerase, once again, is building a new strand in the 5' to 3' direction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:36
But there's a bit of a problem here. See, as DNA unwinds, because DNA polymerase can only build the new strand in the 5' to 3' direction, it has to keep racing up here next to where this unwinding is happening.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:49
You can see why, then, this new strand is known as the lagging strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:54
On this lagging strand, primers have to keep being placed in order for DNA polymerase to build.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:00
These fragments that result are known as Okazaki fragments.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:05
Primers have to get replaced with DNA bases, since

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:08
The primers were made of RNA. Ligase, the gluing enzyme, as I like to nickname it,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:13
has to take care of the gaps between Okasaki fragments.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:16
sealing them together. At the end of replicating, you have two identical double helix DNA molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:23
From your one original double helix DNA molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:27
We call it semi-conservative because the two copies each contain one old original strand,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:34
And one newly made one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:36
One last thing. Surely you've had to proofread your work before to catch errors?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:41
In this process, you don't want DNA polymerase to make errors. If it matches the wrong DNA basis, then you could have an incorrectly coded gene.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:48
Which could ultimately end up in an incorrect protein, or no protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:53
DNA polymerase is awesome. It has

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:55
Proofreading ability, meaning it rarely makes a mistake.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:59
Which is a good thing. So remember how we said there is far more detail to this process to explore?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:05
The detailed understanding of DNA replication has led to some life-saving medical treatments that can stop DNA replication

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:13
In harmful cells, including pathogenic bacteria or human cancer cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:18
I encourage you to explore beyond the basics,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:20
Check out the further reading suggestions in the video details to explore more.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:24
Well, that's it for the amoeba Sisters, and we remind you to stay curious.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:50
Okay, so hopefully that was…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:54
a little bit helpful for you guys. Um, again, they covered more detail than

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:59
You'll have to know, but they did go over, you know, why it's 5', 3'.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:04
Talking about all the players of, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:07
like, uh, DNA, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:09
DNA polymerase, ligase, helikines, etc. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:14
Let's keep going with the lecture here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:19
Okay, so now we're going to look at RNA structure. So we've looked a lot at DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:24
We're gonna look at RNA. Again, I think this is a similar slide to what

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:28
I showed you, I think back in Chapter 1, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:31
Anyway, RNA, um, ribonucleic acid, is made of nucleotides containing the sugar ribose,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:38
Similar to DNA, however, it, um, has a different nucleotide in one of them, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:46
RNA has adenine,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:48
It has uracil, it has…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:51
Cytosine and guanine. So the one different one from DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:56
is a uracil, with a U.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:57
So this one is in the place of thymine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:01
And as you can see, it's single-stranded, so it only has one strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:06
So, RNA doesn't really need to replicate, only DNA does.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:10
But, um, it helps to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:14
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:16
what's the word? Translate or transcribe the code

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:21
Uh, from DNA to, uh, whatever DNA wants to do. So it's kind of like a game of telephone. DNA has a certain code for whatever protein it wants to create,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:32
And DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:34
excuse me, RNA reads that code,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:37
in, you know, the complementary base pairs,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:39
And then it takes it to another place, I'll show you later, and then it creates the protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:45
So, um, like I said, it's like an assistant, and it helps in protein synthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:51
So, how, uh, DNA can express itself, and how it can express

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:59
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:01
express itself, meaning, like, how it can express, you know, whatever trait or characteristic it wants to express.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:08
For example, like in humans, giving a certain skin color or a certain hair color, or eye color, whatever it is,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:15
whatever, um, it wants to express, it needs DNA to… or it needs RNA to help translate it into protein. So, whatever it's trying to express, it does in the form of a protein. But DNA by itself can't make protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:29
it's stuck in the nucleus, and it's, like, more of a…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:33
you know, it's like a boss kind of thing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:35
It's at the desk. He's not going on the floor and making, you know, the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:40
So, we need RNA to help out with that. And that whole process is called gene expression. So, we go from the gene to the protein with RNA in the middle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:50
So, that's what this is called. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:53
the process of using information from a gene

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:56
to create a protein, or to synthesize a protein. So, the way that it goes, the stepwise fashion it goes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:03
is called DNA, or excuse me, is called the Central Dogma.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:07
Which is, like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:09
a weird name for it, but the Central Dogma.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:12
of molecular biology,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:23
It's the way that all information flows. It's how genes are expressed.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:23
from DNA with the instructions,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:23
to RNA of the assistant to transcribe those instructions to then protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:28
of the whatever protein DNA wanted.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:31
Okay, so remember that for the exam, just in general, DNA, RNA to protein. That's the central dogma of molecular biology.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:39
put a little star on this slide.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:28:40
Professor, I'm sorry, we lost you at the beginning.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:46
Okay, um, from gene expression?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:28:49
Yes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:51
Sorry, I don't know what's happening.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:53
Um…

[Sadye Ruiz] 18:28:53
I think you could just be your connection, because I'm hearing you fine.

[Juan Santos] 18:28:53
No, no, Lillian.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:59
Everyone else is okay? Lillian, maybe it's you?

[Adiel Alvarado] 18:29:01
Yeah, I'm hearing you fine.

[Juan Santos] 18:29:01
Yeah.

[Sadye Ruiz] 18:29:02
Yeah, it's fine for me.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:29:02
No, it shows that it's a…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:29:03
No, I… I also had a problem.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:29:07
Yeah, it shows something that internet connection.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:07
Yeah, I don't know, some people are having issues and some people aren't.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:11
Okay. No worries. Um, but yeah, just gene expression, excuse me, um, the central dogma of molecular biology moving from DNA to RNA to protein. So you have the DNA that's trying to express some trait or some characteristic, and it does that in the form of protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:30
So, it can't leave the nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:33
So you have DNA, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:35
you know, which RNA is the assistant or the translator, um, to DNA to then create the protein. So that's just the biggest thing here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:44
DNA passes its genetic information to the RNA, specifically called mRNA, or messenger RNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:52
Which then can actively participate in protein synthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:56
So, here we have the DNA code, which then gets transcripted to RNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:02
And then that's translated to a protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:05
So, I say transcription and translation because those are the two…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:11
processes of gene expression.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:14
And we're gonna go into both of these. But the first step is transcription.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:18
And the next step is translation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:23
So make sure you write those down, you can leave a little bit of space in between.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:27
I'm going to go through both of them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:30
And you won't have to know all the crazy details, but is important for you to understand how it works. Um, it's an important concept in how

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:39
you know, the DNA can be expressed, and how things can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:44
you know, come from that code.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:48
So, this is a great figure for that. Um, you don't have to memorize it. Remember, for this exam, the only thing you have to memorize is the cell, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:59
cell cycle figure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:01
Um, but anyway, this is a good, um, visual. So, first off, we have transcription.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:06
Which happens in the nucleus. So, if you guys see this purple barrier here and this purple,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:12
That is the nucleus. And then outside of that is the cytoplasm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:17
Remember, that's like the jelly kind of soup that's holding all the organelles inside the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:24
And then here we have the nucleus. So transcription happens, it starts with this DNA, we have the double helix with the nucleotide code.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:32
Okay, remember, when I say code, I'm talking about the different combinations of the nucleotides.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:38
A, T, C, G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:40
And with transcription,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:42
We have half of that code, right? Or, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:47
I guess the parent or the template strand of the DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:51
Um, is gonna tran- and, uh, mRNA is gonna transcribe that

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:56
parent or, uh, template strand.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:59
So, this is… it's trans… uh, it's… yeah, it's transcribing it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:04
So, we have the parent DNA strand here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:08
We have C, C, A, for example,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:11
And the RNA is going to translate that into G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:18
G. U.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:20
Because remember, RNA, it has a U instead of a T.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:24
But if you look with the DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:27
And it says a T, then that means the mRNA is gonna transcribe that as an A.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:33
Okay? Just something for you to think about.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:36
Or to remember. So you have the parent DNA strand, it's gonna tell… its assistant, the mRNA, it's gonna tell it what it wants to do.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:45
And now, we go out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:51
where translation happens.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:52
So, we have this big red thing, it's kind of like a two-part…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:58
Um, organelle. It is a ribosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:01
Does anybody remember? What is the function of a ribosome?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:07
Back from Chapter 4. What do you guys think?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:33:10
synthetized.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:33:12
Pro tip?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:13
Yes, it synthesizes proteins. That's exactly what we're doing here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:17
So, we're getting the code of mRNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:21
From the DNA, and

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:23
The mRNA is going to translate that code

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:27
into three, uh, letter chunks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:31
Okay? Three-letter chunks, they're called codons.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:35
And so this one, for example, is CCA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:38
And if we look back at the original DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:42
That's the same code, CCA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:44
So RNA did its job correctly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:46
It's like a little game of telephone, right? You have the DNA code,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:50
And then the RNA hears it, and…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:54
you know, moves it onto the ribosome, and then

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:57
you finish up with, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:00
the original code again. And that code, CCA, translates to this specific amino acid, which is GLY, which is glycine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:10
And we all know that amino acids, um, are the monomers, or the bases of polypeptides or proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:19
Right? So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:22
Um, that's kind of the way that it is translated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:25
Does that make sense to everybody?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:29
So, again, with the central dogma, we're going from DNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:34
to RNA to protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:39
Make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:41
So, DNA, RNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:44
protein. The DNA has a code, it has a message that it wants to send, it wants to create X protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:52
And the RNA is the assistant to take down that code and take it to the ribosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:59
to create that protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:01
So then it has that code from the DNA, and it, uh, um, translates it

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:07
into certain amino acids, which become polypeptides and proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:13
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:16
So that's the basis of transcription and translation. It can obviously be more complex, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:23
for our class, that's all we need to worry about.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:27
Okay, it's just like a translation. You can think of it like going from English to Spanish, and then back to English, or whatever. Whatever language you want to use.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:35
Okay, so with these codes, these three-letter or three base codes, that is called a codon, like I just told you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:44
And…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:46
Each of those codes, they… or each of those codons

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:50
code for a single amino acid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:53
So, there's 61 different ones, and there's some stop ones and some start ones.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:58
So, before we look at that, though…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:01
Look at this chart down here, and you see that there's different combinations of those bases, right? Of those codons into 3…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:11
letter chunks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:13
And each of these, uh, correspond to a different amino acid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:18
arginine, glutamine, proline, leucine…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:23
threonine, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:26
There are certain start ones and some stop ones to basically tell

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:32
Um, the ribosome, okay, now we're gonna start…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:36
making this type of protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:38
So, or we're gonna start the whole process, right? So, when the DNA first sends the code, that's the first code it's gonna give. AUG.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:47
That's always the first one. And it happens to correspond with…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:52
methionine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:53
So that's the first one, AUG.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:55
And then, when it's done making the protein, DNA says, okay, we're good to go, we don't have to make any protein, it'll send out one of these stop codons.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:04
UAA, UAG, or UGA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:06
And once the ribosome reads that code, it knows to stop making protein. So then,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:13
the process ends.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:14
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:17
So, this basically happens continuously until, um, there is a stop protein, or stop, um, codon that's red.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:25
And remember, each of these codons are here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:30
corresponding to certain amino acids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:34
Okay, that's these guys right here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:37
Make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:42
Okay. Um, I think I have one video. This is another visual of it in your textbook.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:50
Uh, it's a little bit more complex, but if you want to look at it, it's just another way to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:56
visualize it, but you have transcription happening in the nucleus,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:00
If you have the mRNA code in this blue line.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:03
being passed on to the ribosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:07
And then the mRNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:09
Um, code goes into the ribosome, and it, uh, translates into certain amino acids, which are these little guys here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:16
I had to cut up the figure because it wouldn't fit on one side, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:20
Anyway, let's watch one more video, and then I think…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:27
That's it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:29
So, let me pull this up.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:37
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:44
Okay, let me know if you guys can hear it. Let me get a thumbs up if you can hear it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:50
Cool.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:52
And again, this goes into a lot of detail, you don't have to know all of it, but again, just another visual to help you guys

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:58
repeat, you know, the concept and hear it again, and try to understand it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:03
After learning about DNA, have you ever wondered how can the DNA actually result in a trait?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:09
Let's take an example. Like, eye color. Yes, your DNA has the genetic information that codes for the color of your eyes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:16
Your eye color is based on a pigment that is inside the eyes, but in order to have that pigment,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:22
You have genes, which are portions of DNA, that can code for proteins, which

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:27
Help make that pigment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:29
So what we're going to talk about is how your DNA can lead to the making of a protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:34
This process is called protein synthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:37
Synthesis essentially means to make something.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:40
So, protein synthesis means to make protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:44
And you may wonder, what's the big deal about proteins?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:47
Well, you may not realize this, but proteins are kind of a big deal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:50
They do all kinds of things. Proteins are involved in transport, in structure, in acting as enzymes that make all kinds of materials.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:58
In protecting the body, and so much more.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:01
You've gotta make proteins, it's essential for you to live.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:04
And what is so cool is that you are making proteins right now as you sit and watch this video.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:10
It's happening in your cells. They're making proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:13
So, back to your DNA and its role in all of this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:16
All of your cells have DNA. Well, a few exceptions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:20
And that DNA is in the nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:22
Some DNA is non-coding DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:25
Some DNA makes up genes that are not activated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:28
More about that in our gene regulation video, but we're going to talk about genes that are coding for active proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:35
So, how are we gonna get the information from these genes out of the nucleus?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:40
So that the cell can start producing the proteins that it needs to make.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:45
Well, let us introduce you to the amazing work of RNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:49
We have a video comparing and contrasting RNA and DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:52
We'll be brief here in saying that RNA is a nucleic acid, like DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:57
But it has a few differences.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:59
Its role in protein synthesis, also, is huge.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:03
Before we get into the process, please note our typical disclaimer. We tend to simplify topics, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:09
As always, we hope that you have the desire to explore this complex, amazing process later on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:14
To learn all about the extra information that we don't have the ability to include in this short video.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:19
In protein synthesis, we can look at two major steps. One is transcription, and the other is translation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:27
Transcription has a C in it, and translation has an L in it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:31
I remember that C comes before L in the alphabet, which helps me remember that transcription comes first.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:38
I like a lot of alphabet mnemonics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:41
Now, transcription is when we're going to transcribe the DNA into a message. In your cells, the DNA is in the nucleus, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:48
Therefore, we're doing transcription in the nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:52
In the step of transcription, an enzyme called RNA polymerase will connect complementary RNA bases to the DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:00
These RNA bases are bonded together to form a single-stranded mRNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:05
The M in mRNA stands for messenger.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:08
Messenger RNA consists of a message made of RNA that has been based on the DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:14
We do want to mention that this mRNA is not usually ready to go right away. There's usually a significant amount of mRNA editing that occurs,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:23
We highly encourage you to do some reading about that, because it's not only fascinating, it's critical for the process to work correctly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:30
So what's something great about being mRNA?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:32
Well, in eukaryotes, you get out of the nucleus. The mRNA can go out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it's going to attach to a ribosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:41
Ribosomes make protein. The ribosome is made of rRNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:49
And that's an easy one to remember, because the R stands for ribosomal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:50
RNA. The ribosome is going to build our protein in the next step, called translation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:56
You know, you can find a lot of great clips and animations on translation that are just fantastic.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:02
We're just going to break down some basics of what's happening.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:05
In the cytoplasm, if you look at this, you have all these tRNA molecules available.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:10
tRNA stands for transfer RNA. They carry an amino acid on them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:15
An amino acid is the monomer for a protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:19
It's a building block for protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:21
Since we're making proteins, we're going to need those amino acids to build it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:25
If you have a bunch of amino acids together, you can build a protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:29
So it's the tRNA that is going to bring those amino acids together to make that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:35
But wait, how does the tRNA know which amino acids to bring?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:39
That's why the mRNA, the message, is so important, because it's going to direct which tRNAs come in, and therefore which amino acids are transferred.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:48
All of these tRNAs are looking for complementary bases. When they find the complementary bases on the mRNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:55
They transfer their amino acid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:57
When tRNA is bringing in the amino acids, it reads the bases, represented by these letters here on the mRNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:05
in threes. So it doesn't read one letter at a time, it reads in triplets.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:10
That's called a codon. So, for example, in this mRNA, the tRNA would read the codon

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:17
A U. G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:18
One of these tRNAs contains a complementary anticodon.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:22
Which, in this case, is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:25
UAC.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:26
All tRNAs that have the anticodon UAC will be carrying an amino acid called methionine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:34
A tRNA with the UAC anticodon comes in to pair with the complementary AUG codon

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:40
On the mRNA, it transfers the amino acid it carries, methionine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:45
The tRNA will eventually leave, but it will leave behind its amino acid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:50
That's the first amino acid before looking at the next codon.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:53
Before we do the next codon to carry this on, if you're wondering, how did you know that the tRNA that went with the AUG codon

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:02
would be carrying an amino acid called methionine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:05
Well, for that, you will find a codon chart helpful. You can learn to use a codon chart to determine

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:11
Which amino acid each mRNA codon will code for?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:15
Isn't it so fascinating that scientists have been able to determine which amino acid corresponds with these codons?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:21
I used to have a code on chart poster and just marvel at that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:25
You could see on a codon chart that the AUG codon on the mRNA

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:30
codes for methionine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:32
AUG is also considered a start codon, as methionine is typically going to be your first amino acid in proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:39
There are many types of amino acids in the codon chart, but there are even more possible codon combinations.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:45
That means there can be more than one codon that code for the same amino acid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:50
For example, according to the mRNA codon chart,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:54
All of these mRNA codons here code for the same amino acid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:58
Leucine. That means their complementary tRNAs all carry the same amino acid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:04
Leucine. Okay, so going back to the mRNA, let's try the next codon on this mRNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:11
CCA. On the codon chart, you can see that codes for the amino acid proline.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:16
The complementary tRNA has the anticodon GGU,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:21
There's the proline that we knew it would be carrying.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:24
The tRNA will transfer that amino acid and eventually leave where it can pick up another amino acid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:30
These amino acids are held together by a peptide bond, and it will keep on growing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:36
Typically, at the very end of the mRNA, there is a stop codon.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:40
Subcodons do not code for an amino acid, but when the ribosome reaches it, it indicates that the protein building is finished.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:48
So, the result of translation is that you built a chain of amino acids,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:52
that were brought in certain sequences based on the coding of the mRNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:57
But remember, that mRNA was complementary to the DNA, so the DNA ultimately was the director of the entire protein building.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:05
Of course, it couldn't have done it without some serious help from mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:11
Protein folding and modification may occur, and the protein may need to be transported,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:16
This can all vary based on the protein structure and function.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:20
Another fascinating topic for another Amoeba Sisters video.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:24
Well, that's it for the Amoeba Sisters, and we remind you to stay curious.

Sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:06
Okay.

[Gabriela Quintiliano] 18:48:08
Professor, I have a question. Um, wind heat affects the protein, is it affecting, like, the… peptid bounce, or the hydrogens and ions bounce.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:09
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:22
When the heat is, what'd you say? When the wet?

[Gabriela Quintiliano] 18:48:24
When the heat affects. like, the protein, is it affecting, like, the peptide bounce, or it's affecting, like, the hydrogen bounds and the ions bounds?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:35
the peptide bonds, yeah.

[Gabriela Quintiliano] 18:48:38
Oh, okay, directly, okay, I see.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:39
Yeah, mm-hmm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:41
Because in proteins, those are the main types of bonds. There's no hydrogen bonds in peptide… in protein, there's just the peptide bond, which is a type of covalent bond.

[Gabriela Quintiliano] 18:48:51
Okay, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:52
Good question.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:54
Okay, so that's it for tonight. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:59
If you want to review those videos, those links are going to be in the PowerPoint.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:03
