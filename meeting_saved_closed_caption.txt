[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:49
Um, let's go through the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:52
syllabus, just to see where we're at in class, and reminder, everyone can please turn your cameras on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:59
It's part of your attendance, I'm going to be putting in

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:02
those grades in the next couple…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:06
Um, weeks, so finalizing those attendance grades.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:11
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:14
Let's see, share…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:17
Okay, so here's our syllabus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:21
And…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:24
Okay, so you guys just took your exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:27
Um, on Thursday.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:30
And then tonight, we're gonna go over Chapter 14, uh, Evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:35
Obviously, Thursday… next Thursday, we don't have class because it's Thanksgiving, and then the week after that, we have Chapter 31, our last chapter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:43
So we only have 2 more lectures left, and those two lectures are going to be on the last exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:49
Um, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:53
Let's see… let me stop sharing, but let me see the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:58
grades for the exam 3.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:01
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:03
I haven't input the extra credit yet, so if you aren't the happiest with your grade, but you know that you have extra credit coming, um, I have to put that in still, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:15
Um, just give me a little bit of time to do that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:20
Quiz statistics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:25
Yeah, so scores increased again, average was an 80.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:28
The highest was a 98, so someone almost got a perfect score. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:33
And then we have…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:36
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:38
Average time, about 40 minutes to take the exam. So yeah, most of you did seemingly pretty well, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:45
If you're not the happiest with your grade, um, remember I'm inputting extra credit, and hopefully you took advantage of the extra credit that I gave you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:53
Like I said, it's gonna be about a whole letter grade if you submitted all three of the

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:58
Photos, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:01
And…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:03
Yeah. Anyone have any questions about anything before we start chapter…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:09
14?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:16
No?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:45:18
No, professional.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:19
Okay. No worries. Okay.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:45:19
No, Professor

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:23
So, let's go ahead and start.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:28
Right here…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:34
Let's over…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:36
Okay, so Chapter 14, Darwin and Evolution, um, let me record my screen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:48
Perfect.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:50
Okay, so Chapter 14, Darwin and Evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:54
First, we're going to look at Darwin's theory of evolution. But first off, who is Charles Darwin? This is Charles Darwin over here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:00
He was an English student of nature, and he was very observant, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:06
Student of nature, just meaning he loved nature and the environment and science, so he loved to

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:13
collect different things, and…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:15
you know, collect specimens, organisms, rocks, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:19
Um, he just loved nature.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:22
He was super observant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:24
observant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:28
Um… he, like I said, collected things. He loved collecting insects, he loved geology, which is the study of rocks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:34
And he also loved biology.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:37
When he was 22, he went aboard the HMS Beagle as their naturalist. So the HMS Beagle was a ship

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:47
Um, for an extra credit point on the last exam. Don't look it up.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:52
someone tell me, what does HMS stand for?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:57
Does anyone know? HMS?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:59
Don't look it up, just from your brain.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:03
Does anyone know what HMS stands for?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:05
Um, Charles Darwin was around… I'll give you a hint. He lived around the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:12
mid-1700s, I think, or mid-1800s?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:15
mid-1800s. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:17
So, there were kings and there were queens in England.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:22
So, I don't know if that helps anybody.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:47:28
I have an Latamo, but I cannot, like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:28
You know?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:32
That's okay, don't worry. It's Her Majesty's ship.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:36
So, Her Majesty the Queen, um, the royal family, the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:41
you know, government of the time, they would basically fund these

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:46
um, these trips to go out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:48
Um, and, you know, these exploration trips, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:52
And so the HMS vehicle was one of them. The trip was only supposed to take 2 years, but it ended up taking 5 years. Um, they had a series of misfortunate events. Um, I think they lost…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:04
All, if not… most, if not all, of their specimens on board. I think the ship might have

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:10
burned partially, so they had to, like, get it repaired, and they lost some things. Um, but then they had to continue.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:17
you know, they wanted to continue on and get more specimens and things, so it ended up taking much longer than it was supposed to.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:23
Um, he collected and observed a huge variety of life forms, and obviously a lot of those were different than what he had in England, right? Because he was traveling all over the world.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:32
South America, North America, Australia…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:37
He was in Europe, obviously. I don't know if they went to Africa or not.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:41
Actually, they might not have gone to Australia either. Maybe it was just South America and North America.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:46
But anyway, uh, they went all over.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:48
And he observed species variation, so variations within species.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:54
So, similar species, or the same species, but differences in those species.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:58
And geological formation, so rock formations around the world.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:04
Um, that led him to propose a new mechanism for how

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:09
Um, species were changing, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:16
Sorry, just making sure everybody's…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:20
Muted.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:28
Okay, I guess everyone was muted.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:30
Um, but anyway, so he proposed evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:35
Before Charles Darwin, um, people thought that the Earth was only a few thousand years old, so Christianity was the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:43
main religion during this time in Europe.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:46
Um, in the Western world, and they had only thought, um, the Earth was only a few thousand years old, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:54
you know, around when, uh…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:56
Jesus came, right? Or…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:58
Yeah, Jesus before…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:00
Yeah. Um, so it was only a few thousand years old, and um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:07
the creation of species, basically. So, when God made the heavens and the earth, He made it in, you know, 6 or 7 days.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:13
And that was only a few thousand years old, because that was, you know, the year. The date was 18…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:18
whatever, 1850. So, a few thousand years old.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:22
However, um, George Cuvier was one of the, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:27
Leaders of the time, he was a paleontology… a paleontologist, and paleontologists are, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:34
people who study fossils.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:36
And he saw that the Earth strata had clear succession of life forms over time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:43
So, strata, when I say that word, I want you guys to think of layers, okay? So strata means layers.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:49
So, um, he looked in the different layers of Earth, and he was able to see different life forms, but he was also able to see the same life forms, or similar life forms,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:00
change in their morphologies, or their anatomy,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:04
Over time. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:07
Um, in general, the older the rock,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:11
Do you guys think it's gonna be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:13
closer to the surface, or deeper in the… into the earth.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:18
The oldest rock. Do you think it's gonna be on the surface, where, like, our feet are, or do you think it's gonna be deep?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:24
in the… in the Earth.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:26
Yes, it's gonna be deep.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:28
That's okay, it's gonna be deep. So, the newer rock, the newest rock, is gonna be on the surface, and then as you go deeper, that's… it gets older.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:37
So, he saw, over time,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:39
Um, within the rock layers, or the strata, um, different life forms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:45
So, he thought that evolution happened, or these changes happened, um, through natural catastrophes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:52
And that's, like, natural disasters, basically. Floods, fires, you know, hurricanes, like, really, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:58
disastrous things. And he thought that these caused certain species to go extinct, and then the neighboring species that were a little bit similar

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:06
Um, we're able to take those other species' place. So, for example, in one area, if there was a big fire,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:13
And this one particular species all burned, they all died.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:17
Um, once the fire was over, and things started to grow back,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:21
Um, he thought that…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:25
neighboring organisms that were kind of similar to that species that burned up and died kind of took over their role. And they looked kind of similar, but they…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:33
you know, looked a little bit different.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:35
But we know that's not really what happened. That can happen, but that's not, you know, the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:41
evidence for evolution, if you will.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:44
So there's this other guy, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and he was a biologist, so he wasn't necessarily into rocks, he was more into the natural world.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:52
And he proposed something called the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:57
So let's break down each of those words. So, inheritance. Somebody tell me what inheritance means.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:04
We talked about it when we talked about genetics.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:53:09
Something that you obtained from somebody?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:12
Mm-hmm. It's like a… yeah, it's something you obtain from your parents, so it's a…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:53:13
Parents.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:18
familial thing. It's like a generational thing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:21
So, inheritance of acquired.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:23
The word acquired, does that mean that you got something?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:28
Or does that mean you were born with something?

[Lilian Valencia] 17:53:32
I wanted to say that you got, I don't think…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:53:35
You've got…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:35
Yeah, you got it. Mm-hmm, you got it. You acquired it, right? It's just like the word says, you acquired something, you got it.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:53:36
There you go

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:42
Um, you weren't born with it, per se.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:45
And then characteristics are… we know what characteristics are. So, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was saying, there has to be some kind of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:53
inheritance of acquired characteristics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:56
There must be some…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:59
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:01
you know, inheritance, basically a…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:03
Passing down of certain traits or characteristics that were acquired in

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:09
an individual's life.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:11
Um, basically saying that the use or the disuse of a structure can bring about an inherited change. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:18
using something or not using something can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:22
Um, cause the next generation to have

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:26
you know, that body part or not have that body part, or whatever it is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:29
To be more clear, for example,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:32
I'm gonna go to the gym, and I'm gonna get really, really strong, and I'm going to have tons of muscles, like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:40
And then I decided to have a baby, and I have a baby, and now my baby is gonna come out

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:45
super strong with lots of big muscles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:48
Okay? I acquired those muscles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:51
During my lifetime. I wasn't born with muscles, right? I acquired these muscles over my life, working out, eating protein, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:00
And then he, with John Bapis Lamarck, is saying is that things that were acquired during your lifetime, like me working out and acquiring those muscles,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:09
Those are going to be inherited.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:11
to my… like, by my kids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:14
So, I wish we know that doesn't really make sense.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:16
Uh, similarly, if, God forbid, I lose a limb, let's say I lose my arm,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:22
then he was saying, the use or disuse of a…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:25
of a limb or a structure. So, let's say I don't have an arm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:28
then he was saying then…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:30
the children would come out without an arm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:33
Which we know, that's not how that works. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:36
Um, that wasn't necessarily right, but he did see that, um, more complex organisms

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:43
evolved from less complex organisms. We know that's right, because…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:47
everything kind of started off a little bit simple, and then over time, it got more and more complex. Yes, Lillian?

[Lilian Valencia] 17:55:54
Do we know why he say those things?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:57
It was just a hypothesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:59
Um, something that he thought of. I'm sure he had some examples or something.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:56:03
I was gonna say that he has something concrete that he's… I mean…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:04
But…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:06
Yeah, I don't know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:08
I'm sure he did, um, if not, it wouldn't, you know, be in your textbook, but that was one of his theories.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:56:12
Right, okay

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:15
Um, but the more, uh, complete thing that he talked about, or not complete thing, the more widely accepted thing he talked about,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:22
was, um, looking at the complexity of organisms and how they have gotten more complex over time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:28
So humans are one of the most complex organisms there are, right? We are the most developed, we're…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:34
arguably one of the smartest and the most capable.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:38
on Earth, and we've evolved, basically, some of the latest

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:42
you know, in history, we've evolved the… some of the latest.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:47
So, we're very complex.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:50
And then, um, so this was a good point, but it's not necessarily the mechanism that is driving

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:57
you know, the changes in these species over time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:00
you know, leading to evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:03
So what Darwin thought of is he, um, hypothesized that organ… organs… organisms are related through common descent. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:13
Um, common descent is basically…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:19
looking at common ancestors.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:21
Okay? So, in this example, we're looking at, um, muggies.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:26
And we have humans over here as well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:29
So, if we look on the y-axis here, at the bottom, we have 65 million years ago.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:34
So that's the oldest, right? And as we go up on the chart…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:39
Um, that's gonna get closer to present time of today. So, as we move up and up and up, it's getting closer and closer to present day.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:47
So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:49
Uh, let's see, let's go to this guy here. So this is the last common ancestor of monkeys and apes that lived about 25 million years ago.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:57
This whole thing is called a phylogenetic tree, by the way. Um, I've shown you a couple of these, but it basically shows how

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:04
different groups of organisms are related.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:07
evolutionarily. So, this guy is like a… like a node, right? It's like a little branching point.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:13
So this one right here, this is the last common ancestor of monkeys and apes. So here we have the monkeys group.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:20
Right? And then over here, we have the apes group.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:24
Okay? So this was the last common ancestor, um, that…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:29
you know, came from monkeys, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:31
or not came from monkeys. Um, the common ancestor that split up into two different groups, the monkeys and the apes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:39
Okay? And then similar over here, the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived around 8 to 6 million years ago.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:46
Um, and that's why they say that the chimpanzees and the bonobos are the most closely related to humans. We didn't necessarily come from

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:57
chimpanzees and bonobos, but we have a common ancestor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:00
Does that make sense? But we did come from similar ape groups.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:05
Okay, so we have a common ancestor with these guys, but we're not necessarily…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:11
Um, evolving from them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:13
So, Darwin saw that adaptations to various environments, so depending on the environment that the organism was in, would result in a diversity

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:24
Um, of life. So, diversity in traits and characteristics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:28
in things that we see, um, in nature.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:32
And he based his data on geology, fossils, and also biogeography. We'll talk more about that a little bit later, but he has a lot of evidence for evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:44
So, looking at biogeography, that might be a new term for you guys, um, biogeography is the study of the distribution of life forms on Earth.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:54
So it's not just the number of organisms or the types of organisms, it's their distribution across the Earth. So, obviously, organisms are not

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:03
uniformly distributed across the Earth, right? There's not an even number of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:07
Zebras across every continent and whatnot.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:10
But, um, he wanted, uh, Darwin was using this biogeography, looking at

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:16
where and how these organisms were distributed across the Earth, and kind of finding patterns in that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:23
Um, so he looked at species in South America, and he looked at those in England, and he found that they were different species, but they did have some similarities.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:34
So, he looked at the ones that he had back home in England,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:38
And then he found some new species in South America, which obviously they're different species.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:43
Uh, different continents, but he saw different, um… but he saw similarities within these guys. So this brings me to convergent evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:53
convergent evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:55
basically describing how distantly related species may converge on an overall

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:03
body… body form, or body plan.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:05
Because…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:07
Because they live in similar habitats and have similar behaviors. So, convergent evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:15
Distantly related species, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:18
They are somewhat related, so they are similar-ish looking.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:23
Right? But…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:26
They live in different, you know, areas, and they're different species.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:30
They are similar-ish looking, meaning they converge or have similar

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:36
overall body forms, or body shapes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:38
Because of the environments that they live in. They might live in different places,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:44
But those different places might have similar

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:47
environmental…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:50
similar environments, you know what I mean?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:53
Um, so similar habitats, and this, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:56
show similar behaviors.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:58
So, for example, we have the Patagonian hair and the European rabbit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:04
So, let's go through and look at some similarities and some differences. So, first off, let's look at some similarities. Someone tell me one similarity that they see.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:14
Um, with these two guys. What do you think?

[Antonella Diaz] 18:02:16
There's

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:18
Their fur color, yep, their fur color is pretty similar, it's like a brown, tan with some, like, white and black splotches, yeah, that's one.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:02:25
Okay, the ears?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:26
The ears, not necessarily the shape, but the size, right? They're pretty large and they're tall, exactly. Mm-hmm. Anyone else?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:02:30
Yeah, yes, no.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:02:35
The tail, maybe?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:37
Um, their tails are a little bit different, but they do both have tails, so that could be one.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:02:39
It sounded like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:43
What else?

[Juan Santos] 18:02:44
They lost the rear legs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:47
Mm-hmm. Their hind limbs, yep. They have that similar kind of rabbit-ish shape, right? They have that, like, right angle here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:56
And this guy has it, too, to help them hop.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:59
So yeah, they look pretty similar. They kind of have a pointed nose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:03
They have, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:06
kind of big eyes, not really, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:09
pretty big eyes, and um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:12
somewhat similar sizes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:14
So, for differences,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:16
Someone tell me a difference that they see.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:18
Between these two.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:03:22
The

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:03:23
Yeah, they're ugly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:24
Yeah, the back legs and the hair, they are much taller compared to the rabbit, right? They look a lot taller, so these guys can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:34
probably jump further. Um, while we're on that subject, the hair is a little bit bigger.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:39
than the rabbit. The rabbit is kind of small compared to the hare.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:44
So that's another one. Someone give me one more.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:47
Mm-hmm. The nose shape, that's a good one. So…

[Juan Santos] 18:03:47
The nose, eh, the nose…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:51
You can even look at the head shape. So the hair has kind of a bigger head, right? It has a bigger brain, bigger jaw.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:58
I don't know about bigger brain, but bigger skull, at least.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:02
a bigger skull and more pointed, um, kind of snout. It's more pronounced, whereas the rabbit…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:10
excuse me, has a smaller head.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:12
And the nose is kind of just protruding

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:15
right off of the skull. So it's… it's not as, you know, pronounced.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:19
So, yeah, we got some differences here. The eye ratio, the eyes are bigger in the rabbit compared to the hair.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:25
the ear shape is a little bit different, like we said.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:28
the tail, this one has a little bit of a longer tail compared to this one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:32
So yeah, Darwin saw that, um, with biogeography, so these two organisms live, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:37
One lives in Patagonia, which is South America.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:40
And the other lives in Europe.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:43
or England, they are different species, but they have, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:49
similar-ish body plans, um, because they live in similar habitats. So if you guys look, they're both in kind of a green, grassy,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:57
kind of meadow environment, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:00
that's kind of where they thrive, and where they…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:03
can eat and all of that, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:05
That's… that's one kind of point, um, that Darwin was talking about.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:11
Okay, so that's convergent evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:14
Now, we'll look at, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:18
geology and fossils.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:20
So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:22
in general, talking about geology, Earth, the Earth, is subject to slow but continuous cycles of erosion and uplift.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:32
So, a little bit of geology, um, hopefully you guys know that the Earth

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:38
is composed of a bunch of tectonic plates.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:41
Right? So, we have a lot of, um, liquid and some

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:47
Um… solid on the inside of the Earth.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:51
But the kind of outer surface…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:53
Um, just under the, uh, tectonic plates, that's liquid, so it's, you know, kind of moving.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:00
So the plates on the Earth, the tectonic plates, whether they be the terrestrial, like, continental plates,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:06
or the oceanic plates.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:07
Um, there's plates that are moving around the Earth, right? So when plates come together and they push…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:13
um, each other up, they can form mountain ranges,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:16
If some push past each other,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:18
That's called a transform, you know, boundary, those can create, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:23
earthquakes, and they can create, you know, rifts.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:25
Um, you can have subduction zones, where one plate is going under the other one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:30
And that can actually cause volcanoes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:32
Um, because as the plate is going under one of them, it's releasing the magma, or they'll, you know, the magma underneath, and when it sprouts…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:40
when it, you know, explodes, it becomes lava.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:43
Um, and that's a volcano, and those can create islands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:46
It's a bunch of different, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:48
types, but basically the Earth is on

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:51
tectonic plates, or has tectonic plates. So, with these tectonic plates, in this case of the uplift ones, so talking about the mountainous ones,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:00
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:02
the plates pushing together are, you know, pushing upward, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:07
But on… so that's going from underneath. There's uplift that's happening.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:12
Um, underneath the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:15
the surface of the Earth. But on the surface of the Earth, on the top, we also have other environmental things happening, like erosion.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:23
So, we have uplift from underneath, the plates pushing up against each other,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:28
Moving up, and then we have erosion happening on the actual surface. Erosion is basically, um, like, weathering.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:35
Um, and if you look here in this example, we see these clouds here on top of this mountain range.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:41
this rain is going to basically wash away this mountainside over time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:47
So, basically, every time it rains, uh, the rain can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:52
wash away a little bit of the mountain, so it can take sand, it can take…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:57
sediment, soil, any kind of debris,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:00
And it washes it into these river systems.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:03
Okay? These river systems eventually lead to a bigger river and eventually go out into the ocean.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:10
So now the ocean at the mouth of this river

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:14
has a bunch of sediment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:17
that has accumulated from…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:18
you know, this mountain range.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:20
Um, this weathering and this erosion that's been happening.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:24
So, we have a lot of dirt and debris that are being washed into these rivers and transported to this ocean.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:31
to the oceans. Um, so as we get all of the sediment that's being transported to the ocean,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:39
that sediment will settle over time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:41
Right? It'll sync to the bottom.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:43
And that's what is called sedimentation. So the sediment is sinking to the bottom, and it is creating layers over time of it, you know, building up.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:53
So as the sediment is building up in the ocean,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:56
It's getting, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:00
it's becoming more and more layers.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:02
And underneath, we're having, you know, the uplift happening, and then on the top, we're having the erosion.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:08
So, we're getting these layers. So you guys can see these layers here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:12
This is a yellow layer that looks like it's on the top, that's the newest layer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:16
you see that, like, pink kind of layer, then you see this gray one, this purple one, and then it keeps going.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:22
So all of these layers…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:25
were once…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:27
not where once. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:30
how do I describe this? All of these layers…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:34
have been settling,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:37
And over time, they move down.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:40
in the, you know…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:43
they push down, basically. But, once they get pushed down,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:47
as more sediment, um, piles on top of it, they get pushed back up,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:52
because of the geologic, um, you know, the tectonic plates pushing forward.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:57
pushing upward. So, each of these layers used to be a sediment layer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:01
that was in the ocean. But over time, it's built up into rock.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:06
So, what can happen is these strata, or these layers, can… of sediment, when the sediment is forming and falling onto the ocean floor,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:15
it can cover up any dead organisms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:18
that are on the bottom of the ocean, right? So things die, fish die, whatever it is might die.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:25
And they sink to the bottom. Once their meat has been eaten away.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:28
Um, maybe by crabs or whatever, their bones sink to the bottom, and they get covered with sediment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:35
So over time, more and more sediment happens with the sedimentation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:39
That sediment becomes rock, because it's compressed and, you know, pressurized.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:43
And then that's how you can get fossils. They're… the fossils, those bones, are, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:49
you know, preserved in that rock.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:54
Okay. So, Darwin found a bunch of different

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:59
things kind of to support, um, not to support, I just wanted to explain how the process works, but he… he found a bunch of different

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:07
Um, evidences for this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:09
So, he found raised beaches,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:14
Sorry, guys, make sure you're… you're, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:17
Okay, I just muted him, that's fine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:19
Um, he found raised beaches on the coastlines of Argentina, so he saw the evidence of the erosion there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:26
he saw the effects of an earthquake in Chile,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:29
Um, that caused the land to rise, so an earthquake basically happens when the plates, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:36
go next to each other, and um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:40
you know, they quickly shift, so it causes everything to move.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:44
Um, and he found marine shells, so shells from the ocean. He found those inland, so in the, you know, the terrestrial…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:52
area, which…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:54
you know, why would there be shells in a terrestrial area?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:58
Um, similarly, he found marine shells in the high cliffs of the Andes Mountains, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:04
kind of outline…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:07
Sorry.

[Juan Santos] 18:12:09
Those are 3 lobites, no?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:11
Yes, I was gonna ask. Yes, these are trilobites.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:15
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:18
But he found…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:21
the shells in the Andes Mountains, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:24
Which is weird to think about, because you wouldn't think about, you know, marine organisms being in the highest mountains, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:32
But again, over time,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:35
the sedimentation happening of the water, you know, running off on the mountains.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:39
the sediment occurring in the oceans and settling down, covering those shells, covering those organisms, and then over time, that same sediment layer is being uplifted into the mountains.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:49
So he knew it was, like, a… kind of like a circular process.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:53
And he found, um, you know, a bunch of different fossil species that he, you know, collected from that. But yes, these are trilobites. These are some of the oldest fossils.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:01
oldest organisms, um, and they're relatives of the modern-day horseshoe crab.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:08
Okay, so now we're going to talk about the Galapagos Islands. Um, Charles Darwin

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:14
did a lot of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:17
Studying here, he collected a lot of organisms, and he… this was, you know, one of the main places where he

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:25
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:27
developed his theory on evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:28
So, a little bit about the Galapagos. It's a very special place. Um, has anyone ever been there? Can you guys raise your hand? Has everyone ever been to the Galapagos?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:38
No. Okay.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:13:40
I heard that it's beautiful, but no.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:42
Yeah, it's very beautiful. Um, it's a bit expensive, and it, um, you know, it's a very unique place, and it has so much nature. Um, I was lucky enough when I was in undergrad, I got to study abroad there, uh, for 3 months, so I lived there for 3 months on, um, the island of Isabella.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:58
Um, so yeah, it's… it was an incredible, incredible opportunity I had, but it is really beautiful.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:04
So, the islands are very much like Hawaii. They are a volcanic archipelago,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:09
So there's many different islands, and each of them have volcanoes on them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:15
That, you know, as volcanoes erupt, they create more land, right, because they're erupting.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:21
mag or erupting lava.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:22
And that lava cools and becomes rock, and then that becomes, you know…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:27
a new island. So, there are multiple, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:30
active volcanoes in… within the Galapagos.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:34
And they have a lot of diversity in the aquatic and the terrestrial ecosystems.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:40
Um, they have many endemic organisms, so endemic means that these are organisms that are not found anywhere else on the Earth. They're only found in that specific place.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:50
So, you can't find them anywhere else.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:54
Um, and this includes marine iguanas, um, various species of finches. We'll talk a lot about the finches in a little bit. These are the birds, this is a finch.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:03
right here. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:06
this is a… this is a marine iguana.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:10
Um, and also the giant tortoises.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:13
So, these marine iguanas are really unique because they're the only

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:18
They're one of the only aquatic…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:21
um, lizards.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:23
And, um, they swim, they have really big tails that have been modified and adapted for swimming.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:29
And they eat these little algae,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:33
lawns, um, on these, uh, coral reefs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:35
you know, rocky kind of systems.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:37
So, pretty cool.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:39
Um, this is what they look like. These are all the islands. Um, there's 13 major islands, and there's 7 smaller ones.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:47
Only 4 of them are inhabited by humans, so that's Isabella, this is where I stayed, it kind of looks like a seahorse.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:54
Santa Cruz, Floriana,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:56
And San Cristobal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:59
Santa Cruz, um, has this little island on top of it called Baltra.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:04
That is where the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:08
airport is, so there's only one airport.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:11
And does anyone know what country owns the Galapagos Islands?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:16:17
Brilliant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:18
Ecuador, yep, Ecuador owns the Galapagos, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:22
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:25
the only way you can get there is by flying into either Quito or, um, Guayaquil.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:32
I think I flew into Guayaquin.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:34
But, um, so yeah, you can only… it's very limited access for how you can get there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:39
So, Darwin found animals here, and the animals that he found here were a little bit different than those he found on the mainland.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:48
So they were similar, but they were a bit different, so he thought something was going on there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:53
Um, he also found variation in species from island to island.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:58
So, it's like each island had…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:01
you know, their own adaptations and their own environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:04
that helped, um, you know, create those variations in those species.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:11
But yeah, very…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:13
Very special place. So, the Galapagos finches…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:17
Um, the finches are birds, so these are some examples of the birds.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:22
He found a variation in their beak size.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:25
So, you can see their beaks here. This one has a big beak, this one has kind of a medium, sharp beak, and this one has a super pointed beak.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:32
So, for example, this guy on the left, the ground-dwelling finch. So, ground-dwelling means he hangs out on the ground.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:39
So, their beak size depends on the size of the seeds that they eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:45
So, they have adapted to eat seeds that they find on the ground.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:49
And depending on how big those seeds are is what dictates how big their beak is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:55
you know, over time, through evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:57
So, if they have found a bunch of

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:00
Small seeds, their beaks don't have to be so big, right? They can, you know, allocate more energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:07
do other things instead of, uh, growing a beak.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:09
Whereas if they had, um, really big seeds, which this guy looks like he was eating a lot of big seeds,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:15
Um, you know, their beaks have gotten bigger, so then him and all his ancestors… not his ancestors, um, his whole family and that whole population that's there,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:25
Um, over many generations, they have, you know, adapted to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:31
or evolve to eat those bigger seeds.

[Juan Santos] 18:18:33
Professor!

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:34
Yes.

[Juan Santos] 18:18:36
Why… why two cans has so long beak?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:41
They've become especially adapted to whatever they're eating. I don't know what they eat,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:46
Um, but they have something really big. They have a really big beak to crack open, you know, whatever they're eating.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:53
It also doesn't have to be necessarily, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:58
food-driven, it could also be, you know, the bigger the beak, the more females you get.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:03
Right? You want to have more mates, so you have more options for breeding.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:07
So, it could be that the bigger, prettier, you know, brighter colored beak

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:11
individuals would get more mates. It just… it just depends, but I don't know too much about two kinds, sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:18
Um, and then this middle guy here, this is the woodpecker finch. So, tree-dwelling…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:25
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:26
benches, uh, they…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:31
Um, obviously hang out in the trees.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:33
And woodpecker, you, you know, peck the wood.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:36
So this guy has to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:40
Um, peck the wood, and he eats the grubs, or the little, like, insects, basically, inside of the wood.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:47
that are living inside the tree. So, depending on the size of the insects or the size of the grubs that they were eating, that determines how big their beak is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:55
And then cactus-eating finches, these guys over here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:59
They have a specially adapted long, pointed beak,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:02
Because, um, they have been able to get the nectar, or, like, the sweet, you know, juice, from the cactus flowers.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:11
So, there's a lot of cactuses, or cacti, in the Galapagos, and some of them produce really big, beautiful flowers. They kind of look like hibiscus flowers.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:21
Um, but they do have…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:24
Um, and they do have the nectar inside of the flower, so these guys…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:28
I've been, uh, have adapted to eat that flower the nectar inside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:34
Um, but yeah, over time, it could be, you know, it just depends on the environment, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:39
let's say, for example, there was no more seeds on the ground, or, you know, these guys were out-competed for the seeds, so they weren't able to eat any of the seeds.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:49
And they weren't able to eat any of the insects, so they had to find another form of sustenance, right? And one…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:54
you know, stumbled on a flower, and…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:57
figured out it could eat the nectar, so then over time, with generations, those individuals with the longer beaks

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:04
have been able to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:06
get that nectar, get that nutrients, and transform that nutrients into

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:10
offspring. That whole thing is, like, natural selection, and I'm gonna talk about that in just a second, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:16
that's kind of how it happens.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:19
So, each of these guys have adaptations, right? Their beaks have adapted to whatever

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:25
you know, food source or environment that they've been in.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:28
So an adaptation is any characteristics that… any characteristic

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:32
that makes an organism more suited to its environment, or most fit, or most…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:38
you know, adapted, if you will, to use the same word.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:42
Okay, so make sure you know the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:44
Um, definition of adapted. I'll leave this slide for a second. Yes, Victor?

[Victor Hernandez Arteaga] 18:21:51
Hey, teacher, I'm really sorry I'm late, I was, uh, at work.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:55
That's okay.

[Victor Hernandez Arteaga] 18:21:58
Alright, sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:58
That's okay. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:01
So, adaptation. It often takes many generations for an adaptation to become

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:07
established in a population.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:10
So, it doesn't just happen overnight.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:12
It doesn't just happen, oh yeah, you know, this individual's gonna grow a really big beak, that's not how it happens.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:19
It's basically selectively choosing nature or the environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:24
is selectively choosing

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:26
which organisms are going to be best suited,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:29
depending on, you know, those environmental variables.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:33
Okay, and we'll talk more about that in a second.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:40
Okay, so with the finches, Darwin thought that many, many years ago,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:47
Benches were on the mainland, Ecuador.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:50
Right? So those finches on the mainland came to the islands,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:55
They reproduced, and with each of the island's unique and isolated environments. So that's really important.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:02
Each of these islands have a bit of an isolated environment, right? It's an island.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:07
Sure, a bird could fly from island to island, and they look kind of close, but that could be a lot of miles, and that can, you know, prevent some

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:15
birds from going across, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:18
Um, each of the habitats, there's…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:21
you know, they're similar islands, but there are different habitats on each of the islands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:27
Depending on the different elevations you go.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:29
But anyway, um, so the mainland birds came to the Galapagos, they reproduced, and with each of the different, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:38
and unique environments on each of the islands,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:41
The finches, the birds, evolved independently, or on its own.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:46
from the initial mainland species.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:50
Okay? So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:52
The three that I talked about, there are so many more. There's a bunch of… a bunch of other ones, too.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:57
But…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:00
these, um… these are different species that live on, you know, these different islands here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:07
Okay, so now let's look at the tortoises. So, each of the Galapagos Islands also seem to have their own type of tortoise.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:15
at least that Darwin saw.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:17
So, long-neck tortoises, these guys were found in dry areas with really sparse vegetation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:24
Sparse means there's not much vegetation. Um, you can kind of see there's, like, some trees,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:30
With not many leaves on it,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:32
There are, um, taller cactuses, like, this is what one of the cactuses look like.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:39
So… sorry, guys.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:41
The long-necked tortoises,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:44
evolved and adapted over time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:47
to reach those taller cactuses so they could eat that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:51
Because there really wasn't much vegetation that they could eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:55
And tortoises, obviously, as we know, do not move very fast, right? So they couldn't just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:00
you know, walk over really quick to find more vegetation, they kind of had to work with what they had in their near vicinity.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:09
Similarly, short-necked tortoises were found in the very moist regions with abundant ground foliage.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:17
So, some parts of the Galapagos are like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:20
a desert. Not a desert, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:23
Yeah, kind of like a desert. Very dry, very arid.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:26
Um, very rocky with cactuses. It's very dry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:31
Other parts of it are, like, a jungle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:33
very moist, very tropical, very lush, lots of moisture and rain, lots of greenery.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:40
And that's, like, these areas here. So there's abundant ground foliage here. There's lots of grass on the floor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:46
Um, and leaves and, you know, things, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:49
these organisms did not have to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:53
or excuse me, yeah, these short-necked tortoises did not have to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:57
reach for the cactuses, because number one, there are no cactuses in that area, but number two, they didn't have to because they had abundant, like, as much as they wanted to eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:07
grass and greenery on the floor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:09
So, it did not need to evolve that long neck, because it just had to bend down its neck and eat on the floor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:15
Whereas these guys had to evolve a longer neck over time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:19
Um, you know, in order to reach those cacti.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:24
Okay, so all of these examples is basically describing natural selection. So natural selection is the mechanism for how evolution happens.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:34
So… evolution is, you know, the change over time of organisms, right? It's the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:41
evolution or the adaptation of organisms over time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:44
But how does this happen? How does evolution happen?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:48
it happens by, uh, natural selection. So this is what happens. This is a super important slide. This…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:56
you know, write this whole thing down, it'll help you remember.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:59
And give you the general concept of how evolution works.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:02
And I've kind of briefly explained it before, but I'll… I'll, of course, go through it again.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:08
So first off,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:10
Members of a population are gonna have heritable variations, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:15
So, let's think about the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:18
Um, you know, the long-necked tortoises, okay? So the long-necked tortoises

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:24
So tortoises in general, they… a certain population of them, they have heritable variations.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:29
Meaning, some of the necks of the tortoises are longer, and some of them are shorter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:34
Maybe some of the tortoises are bigger and more muscular, maybe some of them are skinnier.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:39
Right? There's different variations.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:43
within the population.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:44
Just like human population, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:47
In this class right now, we're… we could be a population of humans. We all have different heights,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:52
We have different skin color, different hair color, eye color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:56
different, um, bone structure, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:59
These are variations that we have, and they're heritable. We can pass on our traits, these traits that we're born with, genetically,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:07
to our offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:08
Same thing with the tortoises.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:11
They can pass on their long-neck jeans to their offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:17
There has to be variation. Number two…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:20
The population is going to produce more offspring than the resources that environment can support.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:27
So, there's basically more organisms

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:30
then there are available resources.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:34
So, with the tortoises,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:36
There's gonna be more tortoises available than the cacti they could eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:42
Okay? Let's say there's nothing else to eat other than cacti, cactuses.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:47
So, there's gonna be more tortoises…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:50
then the cacti available.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:52
That causes competition.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:54
between the tortoises, right? Who can get the cactus?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:57
first, or who can reach the cactus and eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:02
So those individuals with the most favorable traits,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:06
in our… in our example, the tortoises with the longest necks, these are the most favorable because they can reach those cacti.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:14
If you can't reach it, you don't eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:16
Right? And you die.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:18
So, those individuals with the most favorable traits are going to survive, they're gonna eat, and they're gonna survive.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:25
And they're gonna reproduce. So they're gonna turn those resources, the food they just ate,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:30
into offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:33
And they're gonna do that more so to a greater extent,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:38
than those who lacked the favorable traits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:41
So the short-necked tortoises, who weren't able to eat as much,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:44
cannot turn…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:46
you know, that into as many offspring, because they're not eating as much. They can't… they can't have as many kids, or they just might die if they won't eat enough.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:54
But the long-necked tortoises

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:57
can eat a lot of, um, cacti.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:59
And so if they have plenty of food,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:02
they can have plenty of kids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:05
So over time, the population of the favorable trait, in our case the long-necked tortoises,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:11
are gonna increase in the population.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:14
and the population will then become adapted to that environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:18
So, those organisms, the long-necked tortoises, the number, they're numbers, it's literally just a numbers game. The number of them are gonna increase

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:28
And the number of the short-necked tortoises are going to decrease until they become zero.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:33
And now, the whole population

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:35
of tortoises.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:38
are gonna have the long necks for that one environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:42
Does that make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:46
So, it's an ongoing process, and environments are changing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:50
not like, yes, they're changing, you know, day to day, but like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:54
long-term, you know, big characteristics of environments, they take, you know, longer to change.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:01
But… anyway, that is the process of natural selection. It's just a numbers game.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:07
So, the organisms that are best adapted

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:12
to a specific environment,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:14
are going to eat the most food, they're going to get the most resources, whether it be food,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:20
Water mates.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:22
It could be territory, whatever it might be. They're gonna get the resources.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:26
And they're going to convert those resources into kids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:29
And then the kids will have their adapted

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:32
traits. They'll have their…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:35
their genetic traits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:38
And then those that don't have the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:41
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:44
you know, the favorable traits are going to diminish.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:47
And become less and less and less in the population, until there's none.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:52
Then left. Okay, so that's natural selection, that's how evolution works. And of course, this takes

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:59
generations and generations, many…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:01
many years.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:04
So, like I said, there's gonna be variation amongst populations, and this is essential to the natural selection process.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:12
So, the genes…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:14
that a person has, right? The DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:17
Um, in addition with the environment is going to help determine the phenotype of an organism.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:25
Someone remind me, what is the phenotype?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:27
What does that mean?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:31
Exactly. The physical…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:34
appearance of organisms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:37
So the genes, but also the environment, are going to help determine the phenotype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:42
how they look. So, it's a combination of both of these that give the phenotype of the organism.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:48
And you could think the same, you know, for humans as well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:54
It's our genes, how, you know, what we've inherited, but it's also our environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:00
Um, the food we eat, the place we live in…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:03
you know, things we do, activities, hobbies, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:07
Those kinds of things.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:09
And then I talked about this a little bit before with competition. There has to be some kind of struggle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:15
or existence, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:17
So, this socioeconomist, his name was Thomas Malthus,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:21
Um, if you've ever…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:23
you know, heard of Malthusian economics?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:26
Maybe back in history, or if you've ever taken a business class, maybe they've talked about it, I don't know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:31
But anyway, um, he proposed that death and famine, so famine is, you know, not eating,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:38
not having any food to eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:40
So, death and famine were inevitable.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:42
It was gonna happen, because the human populations tend to increase faster than the supply of food.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:51
That doesn't necessarily happen nowadays. Now, I think we're in a food surplus, like, we have a lot of

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:56
Food, we've been able to grow a lot of food, and…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:00
Of course, not in every…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:03
location on Earth, but overall, in general.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:07
But this concept, Darwin applied this to all organisms, because this is technically still true in nature, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:14
organisms that eat plants or grass, they don't have the capacity to learn how to grow grass, or they can't, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:23
grow grass on their own, or grow plants, or grow fruit, or crops, or whatever. They don't have that capacity like humans do.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:29
But anyway, Darwin applied this concept to all organisms because available resources were not sufficient to allow all members of a population to survive.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:38
So, again, there were limited resources. There are limited resources in nature.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:45
The watering hole might not be as big as it was last year, so there might be less water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:51
Um, there might be smaller territory, because, uh, construction and urban development of humans has made the area go from

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:00
really big to really small, so now the organisms are put under more pressure and stress.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:06
there might be a, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:08
you know, a drought one year, and that there's not a lot of tree foliage, so there's not a lot of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:13
Uh, excuse me, there's not a lot of things to eat, that kind of stuff. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:18
There are less resources than there are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:22
organisms, so the organisms have to struggle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:24
And they have to compete.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:26
In order to exist and get those resources.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:31
Yeah, so competition drives this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:35
Um, and competition is a huge part of natural selection.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:46
Organisms also differ in their fitness, so fitness is basically the reproductive success.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:53
of an individual.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:54
Um, and you're comparing that across…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:57
the rest of the population.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:59
So, reproductive success, so how successful you are at having babies. So, for example…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:04
If I have 5 babies, and my sister has 2 babies, who's more reproductively successful? Me or my sister?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:36:14
New.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:15
Because I have 5 and she has 2.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:17
So, those individuals that have

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:20
more offspring are more reproductively successful,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:24
And therefore, they are more fit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:27
So, basically, organisms in the wild

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:29
they're not gonna have kids if they don't have resources to support it. It's not necessarily like humans, where we have the emotional and the mental component, where

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:39
you know, we can have kids, you know, despite our environment, whatever circumstance or environment that we're in.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:47
organisms in the wild.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:49
they're not gonna have babies if they can't support those babies with adequate food, adequate resources.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:55
whatever it might be, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:58
Um, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:00
fitness is gonna vary.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:03
Um, the most fit individuals are gonna be the ones that capture the most amount of resources, right? We know this. I just talked about this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:11
And again, they're going to convert those resources into a larger number of viable offspring. They're gonna have more kids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:19
So, those are the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:21
If you hear the term survival of the fittest, you've probably heard about that when you think about evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:27
Yes, survival of the fittest. Those individuals that are most fit

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:31
Right? They can have the most offspring because they can get the most resources.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:36
are going to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:39
Um, survive and, you know, reproduce.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:44
Fitness can also vary

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:46
with organisms, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:49
you know, depending on their anatomy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:51
And also on their physiology, so they're internal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:55
Um, and the environment produces challenges to their survival. So, it's not always…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:00
the fittest, like, who's gonna be the strongest, or who's the fastest?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:04
It might be who can camouflage the best.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:08
who can hide from predators the best? Who can climb in the highest tree?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:13
to get away from predators, who can climb the highest tree to get the most food.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:17
You know? So, for example, on dark lava rocks, so lava rocks, think about a volcano that just erupted, and it's basically, like, black, dark rocks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:27
The black snakes are going to be the most fit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:30
Right? Because…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:32
They are not going to stand out from predators.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:34
The birds of prey that are up there swarming, you know, the eagles, the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:39
Falcons, whatever, the big birds.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:42
They can look down at the rocks, and they have really good eyesight, but they can't really see the difference between the snake and the rock if they're the same color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:50
If you put a light-colored snake on those lava rocks, the bird can see it like this, and it can point it out, and it can eat it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:58
Um, whereas in the desert, the light-colored snakes are going to be the most fit, and the black snakes would.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:03
stand up. Make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:07
So… it just depends on what the definition

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:11
it's not what the definition of fitness is, but it just depends on the environment. It could be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:16
you know, it could be, like, a gorilla. Who's the strongest gorilla, but it could also be

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:21
who's the fastest cheetah, or it could be the snake who can hide the best, or it could be the animal who can burrow in the ground.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:29
the best. It could be an organism, you know, the polar bear that can survive the hibernation the longest.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:37
you know, and survive the winter the longest.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:39
It just depends.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:42
Okay, so to kind of show this, um, and compare…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:47
to show Darwin's natural selection,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:50
theory in comparison with Lamarck's hypothesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:54
I'll show you an example with giraffes. So first, we'll look at

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:57
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Remember,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:00
His, um, hypothesis was the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:05
So, all organisms are, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:08
going to acquire things in their lifetime, and they can pass that on to the next generation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:15
So here, he starts off with giraffes having short necks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:20
And over time, these giraffes are gonna stretch their necks,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:24
to reach the leaves on the tallest trees.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:28
And during their lifetime, their neck is gonna stretch, and it's gonna grow.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:32
To reach those leaves.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:34
Now, with continual stretching,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:36
Most of the giraffes have long necks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:41
Okay? That's what he thought happens.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:43
And that doesn't happen. We don't just grow…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:47
body parts. Like, we don't just grow, you know, a longer neck in our lifetime.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:51
That happens over many generations.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:54
So what is more widely accepted in Darwin's hypothesis

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:58
is natural selection. In that original Dirac

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:02
why can't I say this word? Sorry. Giraffe?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:06
neck length varies.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:08
So, we have a short giraffe, we have a tall one, we have medium ones, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:13
Competition for the resources.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:15
Cause the long-necked giraffes to have the most offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:19
So these giraffes that can reach… that have the long necks, that can reach those leaves,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:25
get the resources, right? They can eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:27
So if they can eat, then they can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:31
you know, turn those resources into offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:34
And those that couldn't eat die, and they don't… if you're dead, you can't pass on your…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:38
genes, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:41
So, due to natural selection, now most giraffes have long necks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:46
Okay, so you guys see the difference?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:50
Again, these are technically hypotheses.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:53
Um, but it's a widely accepted

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:56
you know, understanding of how evolution works.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:02
And here, we'll go into some evidence for evolution. Um, let's take a quick break, though, because we've been going at it for an hour. So, this is the last section, it's…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:11
relatively short, but let's take a quick back… a quick break.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:15
Everyone come back in 5 minutes, like, 6.40…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:20
7. Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:21
So go look at something else, go look at something far away, adjust your eyesight.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:25
go drink water, whatever you gotta do, come back in 5 minutes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:36
Alright, welcome back!

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:40
Let's go through and do the last little section here, where we talk about

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:45
evolution, or excuse me, evidence for evolutionary change.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:50
Okay, so there's kind of four main pieces, uh, to this, but first we'll talk about evolutionary theory.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:59
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:00
evolutionary theory states that all living organisms have a common ancestor, kind of like we talked about before,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:07
But each…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:10
living thing has become adapted to its environment by the process of natural selection. So that's kind of what evolution says.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:18
Okay, so all…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:21
living organisms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:23
Have a comet ancestor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:25
In common, they have someone that they're all related to.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:28
But each has become adapted to its environment by the process of natural selection.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:33
So there's four main pieces of evidence. We're going to go through each one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:37
The first is fossil evidence.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:41
The second is anatomical evidence.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:44
The third is biogeographical evidence.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:49
And the last one is molecular evidence, or, you know, DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:54
well, not just ENA, things like physiological, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:58
In our molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:01
But first, let's look at fossil evidence.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:04
So, like we learned, fossils are trapped in the rock, and um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:09
They're formed in the strata, in the layers,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:12
And they form the fossil record. So, again, the older fossils are going to be deeper in the Earth.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:18
And the younger fossils are gonna be a little higher.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:21
So, there is a clear succession of life forms from simple to more complex, kind of like Lamarck was saying, that was one of the things he was correct about.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:30
looking at the strata and seeing that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:34
Um, over time, there are more simple organisms. The older strata, and more complex organisms in the newer strata.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:43
fossils can also act as intermediaries for organisms that we knew existed and are extinct.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:50
And to those that we see today.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:52
So, for example, on the right over here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:55
This is, um, looking at…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:58
amphibians and fish and their, um, intermediary, or their middleman.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:03
For how, um, fish evolved into amphibians.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:08
But first, let's look at this, uh, graph. So here on the y-axis, we have millions of years ago.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:14
So, 380 million of years ago,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:17
That's gonna be older in time, right? That's gonna be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:22
a longer time ago, and 360 million years ago, that's…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:27
Uh, newer. That's closer to the present, right? So fish are older than amphibians, that's what this is saying.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:33
So, for fish, we have a bunch of different characteristics that make them fish. Here, they have a rounded head,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:39
with their eyes on the sides.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:41
They have fins, and they have the presence of scales.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:46
Then we skip to the amphibians, which now have a flattened head instead of the rounded head. Their eyes are on the top.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:54
they have developed risks,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:57
And a neck to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:59
you know, uh, bridge the gap between their heads and their bodies.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:04
And they have expanded ribs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:06
So, they have become a wider-bodied organism with, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:10
wider ribs. So, how did we get from the fish to the amphibian? Um, we recently found, somewhat recently, I don't know, the past 20 years or so,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:20
have found this intermediary called Tiktaalic rosier. This is a real specimen that we found.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:26
Um, in the fossil record.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:28
That seems to be a hybrid between amphibians and fish, and this is kind of that middleman that is the bridge between these two.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:37
So, we can see similar characteristics from both of the groups in this specimen here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:43
So, it has the flat head with the eyes on top.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:46
And the neck…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:49
And the expanded ribs, like the amphibian,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:52
However, it also has fins present.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:55
And scales, just like the fish.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:59
So, we're able to see these…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:03
similarities with these two groups, so you can see, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:07
kind of how that, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:09
process happened.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:11
I will say that the fossil record

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:13
Also, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:16
you know, it doesn't hold everything.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:19
So, fossils mostly occur, um, for hard parts of organisms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:24
So, like, shells, you know, like marine shells,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:27
gastropods, clams, mussels, scallops, those things.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:31
those have hard parts, right? They have, like, calcium carbonate shells,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:36
And those can easily be compacted into sand and become rock.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:40
Um, you can think the same for bones, or teeth, or…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:43
um, hard cartilage, but, you know, the tissues and the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:51
The tissue and the muscle and, you know, the flesh of organisms do not, you know, last in the sediment. They get broken down, or, you know, before it was compacted, it was eaten away by

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:04
Um… decomposers.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:07
But, there are some organisms that don't necessarily have hard parts. Think about jellyfish,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:13
Think about snails,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:15
Um, certain insects, they do have some hard parts, but some of them don't.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:19
Um, slugs, those kinds of things.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:22
Um, there's also just, like, very…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:25
you know, jelly kind of organisms,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:28
Um, that don't fossilize well. So, it's not… the fossil record is not complete. There are some gaps in it, there are, um, some gaps in some groups that just don't have hard parts in general.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:39
And you kind of have to have really good conditions for that fossilization to happen with sedimentation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:46
Um, so sometimes, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:49
the bones can be broken, and they're not with their entire specimen, and, you know, things like that, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:55
In general, there is some good fossil evidence, um, there are some clear examples, um, but not… it's not complete, it doesn't show everything.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:04
Next, we have biogeographical evidence. That's kind of like what we talked about with the Galapagos Islands. Here they are again.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:11
Um, with Charles Darwin and his finches.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:14
So, when life forms are related, they evolve in one area, and then they spread to accessible regions. So that, if you look at this insert here, this is mainland Ecuador, and this is the Galapagos Islands here in orange.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:26
Um, that's exactly what we were talking about with them, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:30
these finches from mainland Ecuador.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:33
blew over to the Galapagos, they reproduced, and they multiplied on the various islands, and depending on the environments on those different islands,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:42
they were able to, um, adapt.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:45
to, you know, those environments. So they looked a little bit different from the mainland ancestors that they were related to.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:52
Um, yeah, that's exactly what I just said.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:56
So, looking at the biogeographical evidence there, we see isolation with, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:04
With an island areas,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:06
Um, we see differences, but similarities with, um, you know, mainland versus island organisms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:12
Um, and things like that. But the finches are a great example of that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:19
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:21
Next, we have… also this, before I switch, you could… this picture shows, you can see all the volcanoes on the Galapagos Islands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:29
There's 4 main ones on Isabella.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:33
Um, one of these is active, I think it's this one. I think it erupted when I was there in 2019.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:39
Um, I was staying over here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:41
That's basically the only town in Isabella, the rest of it is uninhabited, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:45
Anyway, you can see how the islands, you know, the island chain has formed from these volcanic

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:50
eruptions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:53
Okay, next we have anatomical evidence. So, first we have vestigial structure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:59
So, vestigial structures are anatomical features, so they're parts of our anatomy, of our body.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:05
They are fully developed in one group of organisms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:10
But they are reduced or non-functional.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:13
in other groups.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:16
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:22
Sorry, just responding to a chat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:24
Um, they are non-functional in other similar groups. So, for example,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:30
Most birds have wings to fly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:33
But some birds can't fly,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:36
they still have wings.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:38
Right? Like the Penguins and the flightless cormorant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:41
This is the flightless cormorant. It is native to the Galapagos Islands.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:46
Look at his little tiny baby wings.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:49
These things cannot fly. They cannot produce any lift for this guy, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:54
They are left over. They are a vestigial structure. They are, you know, the cormorants are a type of bird, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:03
And most birds know how to fly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:04
Um, wings are fully developed in most birds, but they are reduced, or non-functional,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:11
In this group, the cormorants,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:14
Um, because their environment…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:16
basically didn't call for that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:19
So, they have other adaptations, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:22
that allow them to be aquatic birds, so they swim a lot. So they have webbed feet,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:28
They have a long, pointed beak that they can grab fish with.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:31
Um, and then they have very oily…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:34
um… feathers.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:36
And, um, that helps them with, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:39
reducing…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:41
what is that? What is that word? Hydro…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:45
Hydrophilic, or hydrophobic, basically. They, you know, they're water-resistant, that's the word. They're water resistant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:52
So they can be in the water all the time. Penguins are similar,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:55
They can't fly, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:58
Their fins, or their, um, their wings,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:01
have adapted to be kind of like fins, so they can fly in the water,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:06
But they can't fly on the air, right? So they have changed.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:10
So the wings are the vestigial structures.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:15
Okay, and then next, we have homologous structures, and these are anatomically similar structures explained by inheritance from a common ancestor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:24
So don't get these two confused. I don't know why students get these confused, they're really different.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:29
But homologous structures,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:31
are anatomically similar structures,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:34
in different groups. And these different groups have a common ancestor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:39
Okay? Vestigial structures are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:45
structures that are developed in one group.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:47
but not developed in another group.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:51
So the structures are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:53
either there, or they're non-functional. They're working, or they're not.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:57
Okay? But they're in similar groups.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:00
So within similar groups, there's…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:03
structures that are working or not working.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:05
Homologous structures are similar structures in different groups.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:11
But they share a common ancestor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:13
So, for example, these bones in all of these organisms, they're color-coded

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:18
to be similar. These are homologous structures.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:22
So here we have a whale flipper.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:24
We have this pink bone here. We have a cat leg or foot.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:28
You have this pink bone here. We have a horse.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:31
You have this pink bone, and a human.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:34
I think this is the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:36
the tibia? No, that's in your leg.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:39
Humorous, that's what it is. That's the humerus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:42
So this is your humerus, because this is your radius and your ulna here. So this is your humerus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:47
And you can see…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:49
They're all color-coded for how similar they are, or they're, you know, anatomically the same.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:55
bone, basically, just they look a little different and have different functions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:59
Um, but they all…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:01
have a similar…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:04
somewhat similar function, but they are all similar because they have

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:09
a common ancestor. Can someone tell me, what is the group that encompasses all of these groups here?

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:16
Whale cat, horse, and human. What are all of those organisms?

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:21
Very good. Yeah, they're mammals, so they're ancestral mammal, their common ancestor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:26
you know, had these bones, and they have evolved…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:30
do different things. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:32
The whales, for example, they don't need
