[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:10
Alrighty, hi everybody!

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:12
Good evening!

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:42:15
Good evening, Professor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:17
Hi, guys. Hello, hello.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:20
You guys want to have your cameras on, we can get that going.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:26
Okay, so… let's see. So today is September 25th, we're going to be going over Chapter 5.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:36
Um, so, again, reminder, once we finish Chapter 5, uh, the material today,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:42
You'll have a week to complete your…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:45
homework, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:47
And it'll be due the night before.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:50
the next class, so next Wednesday night, I'm pretty sure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:54
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:42:56
Let's see, so last week you guys had the exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:00
What do you guys think? How did it go?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:03
You thought it was good…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:05
Bad, thumbs up, thumbs down, was it easy, hard, medium?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:11
Medium, I see some mediums.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:14
Okay. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:16
If you guys have any questions about it, or if you want to go over it, you can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:22
message me, or email me, and then we can, uh, do office hours to talk about it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:27
But, um, I did want to mention, um, unfortunately, when I was looking through the lockdown browser footage, I did find some of you cheating on the exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:40
Um, this is a really serious offense, and I'm going to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:45
give an F to those students that I found cheating. I haven't messaged them yet, I haven't sent emails out, I just want to go over the footage again and make sure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:53
what I'm seeing is correct, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:56
Um, I do have suspicion that, um, some of you, multiple people, were cheating, unfortunately. So, obviously, I'm really disappointed by this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:05
Um, I mentioned the, you know, kind of cheating preamble when we talked, um, through the syllabus in the first sem… uh, the first class of the semester.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:14
So, um, I just want to reiterate that it's not, um, okay, obviously, for you guys to cheat on the exams. You're only supposed to be using your brain.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:24
Um, you're not allowed to use your phone or any form of AI, or your notes, or the textbook, or anything. You're just supposed to use

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:32
Your brain. So, unfortunately, um, I will be contacting those people soon. Um, if you already know that you cheated and you wanna…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:41
step up and be honest, you can email me and, you know, give whatever explanation you want, or apology, or whatever you wanna…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:50
fuss up for it. Um, you're welcome to do that. I would appreciate the honesty, um, but I am gonna be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:57
contacting, um, everyone who I suspect… suspected, um, is cheating.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:02
Very soon. So anyway, just wanted to make that announcement, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:06
It's unfortunate I have to make that announcement, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:10
Um, it is what it is. So, anyway, moving forward, just try to make sure that you focus on

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:16
your own exam, and you don't look, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:19
to other sources for the answers. If you guys are struggling with the material, um, you know I'm here. I'm happy to go over

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:27
Uh, PowerPoints again with you if you were confused on something, you can totally ask me.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:32
You can use your classmates, you can ask them and study together if you want.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:36
um, you know, review the homework assignments and all of that, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:39
Uh, please don't resort to cheating on the exams. It is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:43
Pretty unfortunate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:45
Okay, um, so now that that's out of the way, let's go ahead and start Chapter 5.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:52
Are there any questions before?

[Antonella Diaz] 17:45:54
I have a question. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:55
Yeah.

[Antonella Diaz] 17:45:56
I under… I know that you don't record your lessons, but do you mind if we record them?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:00
Mm-hmm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:02
I don't think you're allowed to. I don't think the Zoom lets you. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:06
I don't do that because, like I said, it's important for you guys to come to class.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:12
Um, so I don't record the lectures, and I don't post them, and I don't think…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:17
I don't know, I make it so the Zoom doesn't let anyone else record, kind of for the same reason. But again, you can always email me for office hours, and we can

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:25
If you need to go step by step over the lecture and, you know, talk about slide-by-side, like, I'm happy to do that with you, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:31
Um, for real, anything I can do to help you, just let me know, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:37
Um, but yeah.

[Clery Altamirano] 17:46:37
Sure, but the thing is that for some people, it's easier to go through, like, recordings during the weekends, because we work, like, every day, and after work, we come to class.

[Clery Altamirano] 17:46:47
So it's kind of difficult for us… well, for me, in my case, to go over those things, especially if I have a child, so it, like, it's difficult. Let's say that you are not able…

[Clery Altamirano] 17:46:57
to be, like, responding emails on a Saturday or Sunday, so that's why, like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:02
Mm-hmm.

[Clery Altamirano] 17:47:04
The exam was a little bit difficult, and I would, like, it would be nicer, or it would be easier for us, like, if we get, like, your recordings, that way we can go through it, because not even you go through the, um, materials, but you also, like, give, like, a little…

[Clery Altamirano] 17:47:20
you know, um, comments were…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:22
Extra stuff, yeah.

[Clery Altamirano] 17:47:23
extra stops that we need to… that we need to know, because those things were in the exam, for sure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:27
Mm-hmm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:29
For sure, no, I totally get it, and I do appreciate your feedback, and I definitely will think about that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:34
My kind of answer for that is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:37
Um, when we're going over the lectures, um, since you guys already have the PowerPoints, one thing you could do is just write down

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:45
things that I'm saying, so I think I mentioned this in the beginning of class, I would recommend typing out your notes and just type out everything I say.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:53
Um, I know I talk a lot in class, but you can always ask me to slow down, or whatever. Um, but you can type out everything that I'm saying, and then you can go back to your typed-out notes and write them out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:04
And go through the slides, like, through your notes, so you have the information on the slides, but you also have things that I was saying.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:11
on the side. Um, so that is one option that I think would be really helpful. The second thing for why, um, I don't post the recordings, or I don't record

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:22
Um, it's because I want to kind of treat it like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:26
like, if this class was in person, right, if we were all in person, it… you guys wouldn't have the ability to record. So it's like we're in a classroom,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:34
And we're all, you know, interacting, I'm teaching, and I'm going through slides and stuff, and you still have access to the slides.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:41
But you wouldn't be able to necessarily go back and see that, you know what I mean? So, it kind of, like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:49
just lets you focus on the class, and I know we only have an hour or two or three every week, um, but it makes you guys focus and sit in on this class and pay attention to what I'm saying. I'm not saying you're not paying attention,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:02
But it just makes you, like, focus and take really detailed notes, and that in itself is also

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:08
an important skill, um, to learn. But I do, uh, respect your opinions, and I do hear you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:13
Um, I will consider it for the future, but those are just kind of my…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:18
um, reasonings for the moment as to why I don't put the recordings.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:22
But I do hear you. And if you guys need…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:24
like I said, just more help, um… let me see, I saw something about office hours in the chat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:33
Um, transcript…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:37
Maybe? I think that's kind of similar to looking back at the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:43
That's kind of the same answer. It's like, if we were in person, you wouldn't be able to have a transcript. It's the same kind of answer that I said.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:51
Um, but is there a set time frame for your office hours? No. On my syllabus, you see that there's no, uh, set time for office hours, but you guys can email me.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:59
And we can set up a time that works best for both of us.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:02
Um, and it'll be over Zoom, of course, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:05
Okay? I will also say that this first exam is probably one of the harder exams. It's the first one that you guys have done with me.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:14
Um, it is one of the longer ones.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:16
And, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:18
Actually, it might be the same.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:20
length, but it's the first exam you've taken with me, so you figure out how I ask my questions,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:26
And you kind of get a feel for the class, and the material is new. It's like learning a new language, right? So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:31
it's kind of… excuse me, it's a little bit difficult. Um, the second exam,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:37
might also be a little bit difficult, just because of the concepts. It's not like I'm trying to make the exams difficult on purpose, but the concepts might be a little difficult.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:45
But then the third and the fourth exam, students usually really like the material, and they perform really well on the exams. So I just will say, as, like, an aside, for my class, the first half of the class is

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:56
a bit difficult, because it's, you know, the kind of foundational…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:00
introductory biology topics that are… can be difficult for people, but then the second half of the class gets more interesting and more…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:07
you know, more… more fun, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:11
that is kind of for that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:13
Any other questions before we start?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:19
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:21
Okay, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:25
Let's go with the PowerPoint…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:29
Let me find it here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:47
Okay, can you guys see Chapter 5, the dynamic cell?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:52
Yeah, awesome.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 17:51:53
Yes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:57
I look better after COVID, thank you. Yeah, I was not feeling well at all.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:03
before, but I'm feeling much better now.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:06
Okay. So, Chapter 5, the dynamic cell. Okay, so now that we've kind of had that spiel before,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:13
Um, about trying to take detailed notes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:16
everyone, like, practice it for today.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:19
Um, going through this Chapter 5, um, you don't have to necessarily type what's on the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:25
screen, right? You can if you want to, but you have access to it already.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:29
So you can just write the title of the slide, and then you can, you know, say the things that I'm saying. A lot of the things I'm just kind of explaining, I'm not necessarily

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:38
Um, sometimes I'm giving you more information, but a lot of the time I'm just explaining things more thoroughly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:44
Or, you know, saying some type of metaphor or something to help you guys remember it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:48
Um, but what I would recommend everyone tonight

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:53
type out your notes. Everyone just type everything that I'm saying, type what you think is important. When I say, oh, this is a good exam question, you know, type out and say, exam question, like, highlight it, or whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:04
Um, if you have the ability to type out your notes in, like, a Word document or whatever, I would recommend doing that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:10
And then, when you go…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:12
And look at your notes later, like, over the weekend or any other time that you want to, you can go back through the typed notes, you can edit it, because sometimes you might, you know, do a mistype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:22
Um, and then you can write out your notes and draw any of the pictures in the PowerPoints or whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:27
And, um, that will make sure that you get all the information that I'm saying, right? And that'll help you go over the information again, so that way you have that repetition.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:37
So I would recommend that you guys try that for today.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:40
Maybe that will work for some of you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:43
Okay. So, Chapter 5. We're going to be talking about energy and the energy for cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:49
And all of that fun stuff. So energy is the capacity to do work, and it comes in two main forms. You guys have probably heard of these.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:58
Kinetic energy is the first one. So, kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It is moving, right? It is the energy of things moving.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:08
Plants growing, humans walking…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:11
a ball rolling down a hill, for example. It doesn't just have to be living things, it's just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:17
things moving, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:18
And then, on the other side, you have potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy, so it's energy that's not being

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:27
used yet. It's not being harnessed, um, at the moment. So, it has the potential to move, or it has the potential to come… to become

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:35
another type of energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:37
But it's not yet.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:40
So you can think of examples like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:42
a ball at the top of the hill,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:44
So, think about a hill, right? There's a ball at the top of it, it's not moving, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:49
It is stuck at the… not stuck at the top, it is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:53
stopped at the top, but it has the potential to roll down and become kinetic energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:58
Another example of potential energy is food that we eat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:02
Um, so you can think about…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:05
dot food on your dinner plate or whatever has the potential to give you energy, right? So when you eat it, it transforms into chemical energy into our bodies.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:21
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:23
Um, so another form of energy is chemical energy. There are more forms of energy, but just for our class, we're just going to be talking about

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:32
These three, so chemical energy is talking about the energy in the chemical bonds of organic molecules. So, we all know what organic molecules are, right? Those are the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:44
Um, we talked about that in Chapter 3. Those are the organic

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:48
Um, the biological molecules, right? So those are lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:56
Um, and those are the organic molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:59
Um, at least in our bodies, but there's other organic molecules. But anyway, chemical energy converts those

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:05
Um, in our bodies.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:07
And in living things in general.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:11
In this image, it's just showing you, kind of, potential energy versus kinetic energy. So, instead of the ball rolling down the hill, we have this lady holding a ball.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:20
over a cliff here. So this ball has potential energy, right? She's holding it still, it's not moving.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:26
But, be given its position, it's hanging over this cliff, right? So it has the potential

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:33
to move, but it's not moving yet.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:36
The potential energy in the right image transforms into kinetic energy,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:41
So, the potential energy of the stopped ball…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:44
turns into the energy of motion, kinetic energy, when it's falling

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:49
down, right? Gravity is pulling it down, it is moving.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:55
It's dropping down the hill.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:59
Or the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:01
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:04
So, kinetic energy, potential energy, and chemical energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:10
We can see this… all three types of energy in this image. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:15
It doesn't say chemical energy here, but I'll let you know where it is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:20
Um, I kind of added that in there, but here we have solar energy. This is where all of the energy on Earth comes from, it's where it starts from.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:28
So, solar energy is going into this apple tree here. The green leaves are absorbing the solar energy, and this tree is creating

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:39
fruit, right? It's growing, and part of growing is creating this fruit, these apples.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:45
So, the energy goes into the tree, and then the tree grows the apples. So here is this potential energy of the apple.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:53
Okay, it's just sitting there. It's not being eaten yet.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:57
this person is now eating the apple. So inside their bodies, this potential energy is getting turned into chemical energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:06
And then when this person has energy to move, he starts walking, and that is when he turns into kinetic energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:16
So, potential energy of the apple just sitting there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:19
The guy eating the apple turns it to potent- uh, excuse me, to chemical energy in his body,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:24
And then it turns into kinetic energy of him walking.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:30
So, can someone tell me, at every single energy conversion, what is something that is being released?

[Gabriela Quintiliano] 17:58:39
Heat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:40
Mm-hmm. Heat. So heat is being released at every energy conversion.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:45
The potential energy of the apple,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:47
Um, of it being grown and being absorbed from the solar energy that's being released as heat, the plant releases heat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:55
The person eating the apple, we release heat in the form of body heat, right? Or, like, when we breathe, we inhale, and then we exhale, breathe, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:03
warm air. Brandon, you have your hand raised?

[Brandon Montejo] 17:59:06
Yeah, um, I just wanted to say, wouldn't, um, the person eating the apple, wouldn't that technically be, uh, chemical energy?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:15
Yeah, that's what I said.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:17
the apple itself is the potential energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:21
And once the person eats the apple, it gets transformed into chemical energy in his body. Yeah, that's what I was saying.

[Brandon Montejo] 17:59:29
Oh, okay, sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:30
You're good, no worries.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:32
Um, and then the person starts walking, and, you know, the more you exercise, the more you move around, the more heat you release, right? You get hot, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:42
That's where that is coming from. So this has to do with the different, um, the two different laws of thermodynamics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:49
So we're gonna talk about the first one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:51
And then we'll talk about the heat one later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:54
But the first law of thermodynamics, this is called the law of conservation of energy. So we're trying to conserve energy here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:02
Um, thermodynamics, that big word, um, if you break it down thermo,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:09
basically means energy or heat, if you want to think about it, like thermometer, right? Like temperature.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:14
So, think about it like energy, and then dynamics. That's kind of like, um, a dynamic, like a moving…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:22
system. It's basically a system. So, an energy system. You can think about it like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:27
So the first law of thermodynamics says that energy cannot be created or destroyed

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:33
But it can be changed from one form into another.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:37
Okay? So you can't just create energy out of nothing, and you also can't destroy it and turn it into nothing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:44
But, certain forms of energy can be turned into other forms of energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:49
So, for example, just like we talked about,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:51
Eating an apple changes the potential energy of the apple into chemical energy in our bodies.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:59
And then that chemical energy

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:01
is transformed into kinetic energy when we…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:05
move, or we walk, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:08
So that's the first law. That's just a little…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:12
memorization.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:21
So that's the first law of thermodynamics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:24
And the second law of thermodynamics talks about

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:30
the release of energy and how, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:35
energy transformations are not 100% efficient.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:38
So, energy cannot be changed from one form into another without the loss of usable energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:46
So that usable energy…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:49
is, for example, heat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:51
Just like we saw in that image before.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:55
Energy cannot be changed from one form into another without the loss of usable energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:00
It's basically saying that through each energy conversion,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:05
converting potential to chemical or chemical to kinetic, or kinetic to potential, whatever it might be.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:12
Excuse me.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:14
Um, some form of usable energy, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:18
In the form of heat is gonna be lost. It's gonna be dissipated. And it doesn't mean that it's being destroyed, right? Because according to the first law of thermodynamics,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:28
Energy can't be destroyed. It's just being released into the atmosphere as heat, and that heat

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:34
energy is just transferred into the atmosphere.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:37
Okay? So it doesn't get destroyed, but it does get lost from the system that it was in. It was in the system.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:45
you know, of the apple, the person, etc.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:04
Okay, so those are the laws of thermodynamics, and here we can see another example. This is the same one that I went over in Chapter 1.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:13
So here we have solar energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:16
And solar energy, um, like I said, is the beginning of most energy flows. We're looking at these red lines here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:23
And this should be familiar to you guys, solar energy goes to the producers.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:28
Which are plants and algae. You can just think of it like plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:33
In this example, and then…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:37
Uh, you see heat being released from that conversion, and then the consumers are eating the producers, and heat is released, and then the decomposers are decomposing the consumers when they die.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:48
And heat is being released into the ground.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:51
Okay, so every kind of energy level, or every step,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:54
There is some form of heat being lost.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:02
Okay, so now let's talk about ATP, which is the energy for cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:07
It's basically like an energy currency for cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:15
Um, so ATP stands for adenosine triphosphate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:19
You don't have to remember that, but I will explain why it's called that in, uh, when we look at the structure of ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:27
So, cells use ATP to carry out most of the activities, um, in the cells, like making protein, making lipids,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:36
digesting carbs, um, reproduction, growing, things like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:41
Transporting things, etc.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:44
Um, so it's kind of like money, right? They need it to pay for things to be able to do things, so they need energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:52
So, the structure of ATP is a… it's, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:55
It contains 3 different things. So, the first thing is a nitrogen-containing base.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:01
And if we remember…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:03
Um… I'm trying to remember what chapter it was. I think it was Chapter 3, yeah, when we talked about nucleic acids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:11
We have this nitrogen-containing base of adenine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:15
Does anyone remember, in DNA, what is the other nitrogen-containing base that adenine pairs with?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:24
Look back in your notes, check it. What do you guys think?

[Melissa Quesada] 18:05:32
Is it Thaning? Not than, oh my god.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:34
No, yeah, you're close.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:36
Yes, awesome, great job. Thymine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:40
Um, yeah, and I see it in the chat, too.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:42
So, thymine, adenine always pairs with thymine, so that's for DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:47
In RNA,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:48
adenine is gonna pair with uracil. But anyway,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:52
Um, we have a nitrogen-containing base, which is adenine. We have a riboseugar, which is basically just, like, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:00
a structural, like, component. It just holds things together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:03
And then we have 3 phosphate groups.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:06
Okay? So this is how the name adenosine triphosphate comes from.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:11
Adenosine, or the A part of ATP,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:14
comes from this adenine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:17
base, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:18
And the triphosphate, try the beginning part,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:24
of triphosphate. Um, the prefix means 3.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:27
And phosphate means the phosphate groups, right? So these are the phosphate, um, functional groups that we talked about.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:37
I think in Chapter 3 as well. Sorry, I'm trying to remember which one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:42
Um, so, let's see, so there's 3 phosphate groups here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:46
Okay? And these 3 phosphate groups are going to be the key to how energy is harnessed from ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:53
So ATP is just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:55
Um, it's kind of like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:58
It's like a store of energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:00
But it has to be… the energy has to be released somehow, so we're gonna talk about how it does that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:06
But know that the structure of ATP has those three main components, and you can remember at least two of them in the name, adenosine triphosphate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:17
So, how ATP is used and broken down and then regenerated, it goes through a little cycle, and it's really simple. It's basically

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:28
the breakdown of ATP and the regeneration of ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:32
So, how does it do that?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:34
ATP is unstable.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:37
And it can lose one of those phosphate groups pretty quickly, okay? When it loses one of those phosphate groups,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:44
We go from 3-phosphates to 2 phosphates.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:47
So instead of adenosine triphosphate,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:50
it becomes adenosine diphosphate. DI means 2, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:56
So you can see it here, ATP…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:58
Um, then becomes ADP plus that free phosphate group.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:05
So, please write this down, make sure that you know this. The energy from ATP

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:11
losing that phosphate group,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:14
provides energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:16
for the cell. So, one of those phosphates, the one at the end, it…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:21
makes, you know, the whole ATP molecule is very unstable, so that phosphate group on the end, when it pops off,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:28
It is able to release that energy. You can think of that phosphate group kind of like a little cap,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:33
When that cap is popped off,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:35
that energy can be released.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:38
So that's the breakdown of ATP. That's just the phosphate group falling off.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:43
And then, when that phosphate group goes back on,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:46
then that's the regeneration of ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:49
So it's really not much of a… it is a cycle, because it's switching back and forth, but it really is just that phosphate group

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:55
popping on and popping off.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:57
of the ATP molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:00
Okay, so make sure that you know this. In general, anything that I have bolded or underlined,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:05
That's a good idea to know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:10
So this is what it looks like visually, um, hopefully to make it a little more clear for you guys. So here is the ATP molecule. We have the adenine, we have the riboseugar,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:19
And we have these 3 phosphate groups.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:23
So these 3-phosphate groups…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:25
Um, you can see behind here, they have this little, like, star.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:29
And this is showing that this bond between these two end phosphate groups

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:35
are, um, is a high-energy bond.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:37
So, when that phosphate group breaks off,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:40
And everything stays the same, but the phosphate group breaks off,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:44
This free energy is being released, and that is how the energy from ATP can be released and used throughout the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:54
So, remember, adenosine triphosphate, ATP, is fully charged, it's ready to go.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:00
And when that phosphate group breaks off, it becomes ADP, and the battery is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:05
low. Or dead, whatever. Because…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:09
Um, it released the energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:12
Okay, so hopefully that makes a little bit more sense.

[Juan Santos] 18:10:17
Professor? Hmm… And in that process.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:18
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:23
Talk a little bit louder, sorry, it's hard to hear you.

[Juan Santos] 18:10:26
Yeah. In that process of releasing one… Phosphate. What is the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:31
Mm-hmm.

[Juan Santos] 18:10:34
The efficiency of that transformation in percent… percentage. For example.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:40
Um, I would say 100. It's 100% efficient. It releases all of its energy, yeah.

[Juan Santos] 18:10:44
Wow.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:48
So, you can see that here, too, with the fully charged battery, and then the kind of dead battery. It just releases all of its energy, yeah.

[Juan Santos] 18:10:53
But, for example, in a car, when you put. Fuel, gasoline, the… percentage is only…

[Juan Santos] 18:11:05
City sourcing is very low. If you lose in heat a lot of energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:07
Mmm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:11
Yeah. Well, in general, like we just talked about before with the laws of thermodynamics, there has to be some form of energy

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:19
that is being lost, right? But those are in energy transformation, so with, like, in the car, when you're saying you put the oil in the car,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:28
you're transforming the oil from the potential energy of the oil

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:31
to the combustion and the chemical… the chemical energy and also the kinetic energy of moving the car forward, putting it in the engine, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:38
So it has to release a lot of heat.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:40
But this here, this isn't a conversion of energy, this is just a release of energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:45
That's why it's, like, basically 100%.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:48
Does that make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:51
Cool. Very efficient, yeah.

[Juan Santos] 18:11:51
Very efficient.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:54
Okay. So then now we're going to talk about…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:58
metabolic pathways.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:02
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:03
Let me see…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:06
Okay, perfect. So, metabolic pathways and enzymes. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:13
Okay, I think… no, we didn't talk about chemical reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:16
I actually did we talk about chemical reactions?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:19
No, we didn't. Okay. So, chemical reactions…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:22
Um, are things that happen in our bodies, they happen in living things, and it's kind of like a little equation. So, on the left side, there's a reactant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:32
And on the right side, we end up with a product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:35
So it's kind of like there's, you know

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:40
numbers, or values, or molecules, or whatever you want to think of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:45
things on the left side, which are the reactants, and then you have kind of an equal sign,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:50
And then at the end of it, you have the product, so that's kind of the end result.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:54
So, a reactant can become a product with the help of an enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:01
Um, can somebody remind me, what…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:03
Um, category of biological molecule

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:08
are enzymes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:09
Remember the four types of biological molecules I talked about in Chapter 3?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:14
Um, what…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:17
category do enzymes fall under?

[Antonella Diaz] 18:13:26
Heat.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:13:26
Is it protein?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:28
Mm-hmm, yep, great job. It's proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:31
So, enzymes are proteins, and they function as organic catalysts.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:36
to help speed up… speed up chemical reactions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:40
So, catalysts are basically, um, you can think of them like fire starters, or like a match.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:47
So, once you are able to, um, activate them, they can

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:53
ignite this reaction that happens and make it go faster. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:58
If enzymes are attached to, you know, whatever the molecules are that need to go from the reactant to become the product,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:07
Um, they can make that process go much quicker.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:10
Brandon, did you raise your hand?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:14:13
Yes, um… I'm sorry, just to be clear, so capitalists are the… uh, like, what do you mean by fire starters? Like, they're the ones that…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:17
No, you're fine. What's up?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:14:25
Give the energy for the proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:28
No, the enzymes basically…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:30
enzymes which are proteins, you're right. Enzymes just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:36
They act as a catalyst. So, enzymes are catalysts, so you can think of them, they're like the same thing. Basically,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:43
They help to speed up chemical reactions. So, like, let me get to this part here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:48
Maybe this will make it more clear. Let me get through the slide, and if it doesn't, let me know, but let me just show you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:53
So, there's, um…

[Brandon Montejo] 18:14:53
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:56
this molecule in the beginning, that's the reactant, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:01
That's called the substrate in this example. So, substrates are the same thing as reactants, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:07
So this is a green reactant or substrate, and basically, let's say the body wants this substrate, this green thing, to become this red product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:19
Okay? So, the body, it needs something. It needs the product, but it doesn't have the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:25
But it has a lot of the substrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:27
So it needs the help of an enzyme to attach to the substrate to go through a system of metabolic pathways, or basically just chemical reactions,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:37
to transform it to become this product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:40
Okay? So, the substrate…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:44
In some cases, not all cases, some cases, the substrate could become the end product without the enzyme,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:51
But it might take 10 or 20 steps.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:54
But, since this substrate is attached to the enzyme, which is a catalyst, right, basically making things go faster,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:01
Um, it turns the 10 steps or 20 steps into 4 steps.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:07
like, E1, E2, E3, E4. These are vague, don't worry about them, it's just saying that there's just

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:13
steps that happen in between here to get to the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:17
And I'll show you this later in, um, in a graph as well. But basically saying that the enzymes are catalysts

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:25
Because they help reactants or substrates become the products more efficiently and faster.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:33
Does that make sense, Brandon?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:36
Cool. Awesome.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:16:37
Yes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:39
So that's the substrate. Another thing I wanted to mention is you see, um, look at the specific shapes of these guys. They're like puzzle pieces.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:47
So you see how this green substrate is, like, kind of a rounded half-moon on this side? You guys see my cursor?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:54
And you see how on the enzyme side over here, there's kind of, like, a green line that's, like, a rounded half moon?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:02
the enzyme fits perfectly onto the substrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:07
And where that connection happens on the enzyme, that's called the active site.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:12
That's basically just where the substrate binds with the enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:16
And then, once they're connected, they go through a series of metabolic pathways,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:21
And the substrate becomes the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:24
And if you see on the other side, it's kind of like a triangular…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:28
shape, and there's kind of a triangular shape here with the product, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:33
the substrate, with the help of the enzyme, is transformed into this end product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:39
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:44
So we have reactants…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:46
becoming products.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:48
You can say, like, our body using glucose to become…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:52
you know, something else that our body needs. It just depends.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:56
Okay? So, let's look more in depth at their active site. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:03
when…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:05
Um, the active site of the enzyme

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:08
interacts with the substrate, or it interacts with the, um, the reactant, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:14
then it can become active.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:16
So the active site and the substrate have to be connected for the enzyme to become active.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:22
The substrate fits into the enzyme like a key in a lock, or like a puzzle piece, just like I mentioned before.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:28
And this model is specifically called the Induced FIT Model.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:33
Okay? This is the model for how the substrate fits into the enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:40
Okay, so you guys can see the same kind of piece here, the same kind of puzzle pieces, they're lining up. So, if we look at this blue enzyme here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:50
This here is the active site.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:52
And it has kind of a square-ish shape.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:55
And it also has a kind of triangle shape. If you look at the substrate,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:00
It also has a kind of square-ish shape.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:02
With a little triangle shape there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:06
So this substrate is gonna perfectly fit in with this enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:10
However, just because it fits perfectly doesn't mean that it's active. It's not activated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:16
So, kind of like a puzzle. You can put the puzzle piece on top of the puzzle, where it's supposed to be,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:21
But until you push it down to get it flat with the puzzle, it's not going to be a part of the puzzle, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:27
Same thing like a key and a lock. You can put the key into the lock,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:31
But until you turn the key, you're not gonna open the door.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:35
Right? So that's what this induced fit model is. This active site, once it connects with the substrate,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:42
It's going to change its shape slightly, like, just like pushing in a puzzle piece, or like turning the key in the lock.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:50
It's kind of, like, grabbing onto the substrate a little bit, and once it does this, then the active, um, excuse me, then the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:00
the enzyme can become activated, and the reaction can happen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:05
Okay, basically, like, grabs onto it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:10
So that's the induced fit. It…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:12
the fit between the two, you're inducing that fit, you're kind of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:16
not forcing it, but you're kind of, like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:18
pushing them together to make them become active.

[Juan Santos] 18:20:33
Professor Andes, for this reaction to occur. That geometrical.

[Juan Santos] 18:20:41
The figure has to be like that, or… Or not. No?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:44
No, this is just one example, and this is just, like, a vague, kind of general…

[Juan Santos] 18:20:47
I don't know, I mean… Yeah, yeah, yeah. But always they have to couple, like, a perfect.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:50
Yeah.

[Juan Santos] 18:20:54
Perfectly or not. Yeah, awesome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:55
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:58
they can look differently, and they can, you know, have different functions and things, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:02
Um, yeah, in general, that's what this induced fit is. The substrate has to perfectly fit in with that enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:08
If it doesn't fit, it's not gonna…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:11
it's not gonna work.

[Juan Santos] 18:21:13
Oh, wow.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:14
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:16
Okay. So now we'll look at enzyme inhibition, and this is similar with the enzyme connecting with the substrate,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:24
But now we're limiting the amount of substrate that can be attached to that enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:30
So the active enzyme is prevented from combining with its substrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:36
So, let me show… let me explain the figure, and then I'll talk about the feedback inhibition. So, here we have an enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:43
Right? This purple thing here is the enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:46
E1, and here you have, uh, 3…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:51
substrates. I know they look like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:53
It says P, and I know they look like the products from the other page, but just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:59
products can also be used to become reactants for other things, so just go with it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:05
it's a… it's a reactant here, technically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:07
So this enzyme is going to attach with this, um, reactant here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:14
And it's gonna go on and do, you know, whatever it has to do.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:17
But, if you can see, there's only one enzyme with one active site,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:21
And there's 3 of these reactants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:24
So, this whole thing about feedback inhibition, we're inhibiting

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:31
It's… it's technically from a feedback loop, but don't worry about that. We're basically…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:36
inhibiting the amount of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:39
metabolic pathways and substrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:43
Uh, that can be absorbed, um, or used or activated by the enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:48
So this ends enzyme can only fit one, right? It can't take multiple of these reactants, but it can only take one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:54
So, this helps with the prevention of over-concentration of substrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:59
So, in your notes, I want you to write… you can think of this similar to vitamins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:04
Okay? So, the human body, for example,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:08
can't really absorb all of the vitamins that we give it. So, if you guys take a multivitamin, or some form of vitamin,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:15
Um, there's a good chance that

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:18
The dosage on the… on the pill, like the vitamin, you know, pills that you're taking,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:23
they might say over 100% of your daily value. Like, sometimes they're in the crazy, like, thousands of percent.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:30
Our body doesn't need that much, and we're not… it's not just that the more is better, it's not. More is not better.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:36
Our body can only absorb so much of the vitamins. Because of this feedback inhibition. So, our body only has so many receptors, it only has so many of these enzymes

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:49
with these active sites.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:51
It's not that if we put more vitamin, I don't know, vitamin B into our body, we can absorb more and more and more.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:58
No. There's only so many of these

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:02
enzymes that can absorb, so you can pretend these little…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:07
reactants here, you can pretend they're, like, a vitamin B or a vitamin D or whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:11
And, um, there's only so many of these enzymes that can absorb those vitamins. The rest of them just get peed out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:19
So, a lot of you maybe are taking a multivitamin every day, and maybe you're

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:25
TMI, I don't know, your P is really strong or really dark. That's just all of the excess nutrients that your body is peeing out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:32
Um, and you're not absorbing it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:34
So, that could be kind of an example and a good visual to think about when you're looking at, um, enzyme inhibition.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:41
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:44
So again, the main thing, like I said, this is underlined.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:47
The main purpose of feedback inhibition or enzyme inhibition,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:51
is to prevent the over-concentration of substrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:55
We don't want to have an over-concentration of vitamins,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:00
pay, whatever, in our bodies, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:04
Uh, we have this…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:06
you know, mechanism in place to prevent that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:18
Okay. And then, now we have the energy of activation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:23
And this is an important graph, I'll explain it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:26
Oh, sorry, did someone have their hand raised, or did I…?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:30
Did I miss it?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:25:30
I did, but never mind. I don't need the question. So, uh, well, I guess so. Our…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:33
Are you sure, Brandon?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:39
Yeah, ask me, go for it.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:25:43
Are vitamins considered, um, substrates?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:46
Yes, you can think of it like a substrate, yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:51
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:53
Okay, so energy of activation…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:56
This is kind of showing how…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:00
much energy it takes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:02
for that reactant to become a product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:06
And we're comparing it

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:09
the reactant joining with an enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:11
Remember, enzymes make the product, uh, go faster and more efficient. It takes less energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:17
Versus the reactant trying to become the product without the enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:21
Okay? Remember, all of those steps in between.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:25
So, molecules are acting… are interacting with each other when they're activated. We just talked about that with the

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:33
induced fit, and all of that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:36
And there's something called energy of activation, or E sub A.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:41
And this is the energy needed to cause molecules to react with one another.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:46
Basically, the amount of energy needed for the reactant to become a product. You can think of it that way.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:53
Okay? The energy needed for a reactant

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:57
to become a product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:01
Um, so it kind of… if you look at it here, it kind of looks like a speed bump, and it can help, like I said, the reactant form the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:10
And please make sure you write this down, it's underlined and bolded, you guys should know by now.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:16
enzymes lower the amount of activation energy needed in a reaction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:22
So they lower this energy of activation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:25
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:28
I'll give you a second to write that, and then I'll talk about the graph on the next slide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:32
But enzymes, that's their role. They are catalysts, and they help to make, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:40
energetic…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:42
you know, reactions, metabolic reactions,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:45
move quicker and more efficiently.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:48
in, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:51
in reactions, okay? It helps the reactant become the product,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:55
more efficiently, and it… efficiently meaning it takes less energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:00
So, it needs less energy to become activated compared to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:05
the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:07
the without the enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:19
Okay, so enzymes lower the activation energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:23
So now we'll move over… oh.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:26
Juan, sorry, you're, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:28
Your drawings continue to the next slide. Can you erase those? Sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:35
It is important to know that, but thank you, perfect.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:39
Okay, so here's the same graph, and I'll… we'll go over it, and it looks complex, but it's really not. So over here on the y-axis, we have potential energy, but just think of it like energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:51
the amount of energy. And then on the bottom, the x-axis, we have

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:55
the reaction. So basically…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:57
the time it takes for a reactant to get to the product, or as the, you know, as the reaction goes by.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:04
So here, we're starting with the reactant. You can see these little blueberries here, and then you have the product, which look a little different.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:11
just the spacing, but whatever. It doesn't matter what they look like. It's the reactant to the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:16
So first, we're going to look at this red line.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:19
So here we are the reactant, we're going on our journey, and we don't have an enzyme, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:25
So if we don't have an enzyme, and we're trying to become a product,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:28
We have to climb this really tall mountain and expend a lot of energy

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:35
And require a lot of energy of activation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:38
needed to… or sorry, require a lot of energy

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:42
required to become activated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:44
Okay, we need a lot of energy. You see this big energy hump? So if we go up the graph, that's increasing in energy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:51
And then we finally come down, and we become the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:55
So if you look at these dotted lines,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:57
this bottom dotted line is showing, kind of, the starting point, and then we have this top dotted line.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:04
That's showing the, kind of, climax of it here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:07
So, here you can see the distance from these two dotted lines are huge, right? That's a lot of energy of activation that's needed to get the reactant to form the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:19
Over here now, let's go with the green side. So, we have the reactant coming the product with an enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:26
So now, we are the reactant, we're going on our journey to become a product, but we have an enzyme with us.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:32
Now we only have to go over this little speed bump, instead of a big mountain.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:37
Okay? So the energy required to become activated is much lower compared to without the enzyme.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:44
Okay? Then we become the product.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:47
So, same thing, looking at the baseline of this reactant,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:50
And looking at the climax of this green

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:53
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:55
line here. Is this energy of activation, and you can see that with the green arrows, less energy is needed.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:03
Okay, so again, just kind of highlighting and showing you guys how enzymes can help make

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:10
metabolic reactions,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:11
more efficient. And metabolic reactions require

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:16
activation of the enzyme, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:19
Does this make sense to everybody?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:23
Can I get a thumbs up from everybody? Does that make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:28
Someone asked, are the terms reactant and substrate

[Brandon Montejo] 18:31:30
Yes

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:32
Sorry. Are the terms reactant and substrate interchangeable? Yes, they are.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:38
Reactant and substrate are the same.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:41
Um, did someone raise their hand?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:45
Any questions?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:49
Awesome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:52
Okay. Cell transport. So this is the last part of class.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:56
Um, let's take a quick 5-minute break, and then we'll come back and finish this up, okay? So everyone come back 6.36.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:04
Okay. All right. Go take a break, look at something else, drink some water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:14
I'll be

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:17
Everybody, we can start coming back.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:23
Trying to start my video…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:26
There we go.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:30
Um… okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:32
So everybody head back, you can turn your cameras back on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:36
And we can go through our last section here. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:40
We have cell transport.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:43
So now we're talking about how things can get in and out of a cell,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:49
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:51
Yeah, how things can be transported in and out of a cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:54
And some of these processes can take energy, and some of these do not, so we'll talk about those.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:00
So there's 3 different types.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:04
Um, I guess before that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:06
Um, if we remember, the plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:10
Okay, so the plasma membrane of cells

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:14
are… is the external kind of covering, right? It's the protective layer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:20
And it acts as a boundary layer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:22
That can bring, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:25
molecules in and out of the cell, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:28
So, there are 3 different ways that

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:32
things can be brought in and out of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:34
Um, this… the first one is passive transport, the second one is active transport, and the third one is bulk transport.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:43
So, in your notes, I would recommend writing out each of these three.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:47
And then, under passive transport, we're gonna go through a couple different ones, I think 3 different ones.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:55
And then active and bulk, they are just them two.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:59
Um, but passive transport leaves some space, because we have 3 different ones within the passive transport.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:04
And we'll go through each of these if you don't get the names right away.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:09
Okay, so passive transport is kind of like it sounds. It's passive. There's no energy required.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:16
Okay? We don't need ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:18
to get these molecules across the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:24
the plasma membrane and into the cell or out of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:27
There are 3 different methods of passive transport. The first is diffusion.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:32
The second is facilitated diffusion, and the third one is osmosis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:38
Okay? And we'll talk about each one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:41
I'll give you a second if you want to write down the names.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:44
But I guess we are going to go over them, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:48
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:50
Yeah, we'll do diffusion first.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:02
Okay, so diffusion is the first one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:04
And that's when molecules are moving down a concentration gradient

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:09
Until equilibrium is achieved.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:12
That sounds kind of vague, but I want you to look at this visual.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:17
So here is a fishbowl, and we're gonna pretend there's no fish in here, because you should not be putting any types of dyes in your fish tank.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:25
Um, but what we're gonna do is add this crystal dye into this fishbowl.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:31
Okay? A crystal dye is basically… it's just this dark purple thing here. Think of it as just a sugar cube with a lot of purple, like, food coloring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:40
Okay? It's just like a little die, like a little…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:44
color thing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:45
So it's a sugar cube with lots of food coloring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:48
Um, so they put this…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:51
cube into the water, and if you do a zoomed-in,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:55
on the cube and the water, you can look at the molecules here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:00
The crystal dye is solid, so the molecules are very close together, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:05
And the water molecules as liquid, so we know the liquid molecules are a little more spaced out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:12
So, here we have the crystal dye, and we have the water. So, over time, if we're looking over time,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:19
that crystal dye is going to dissipate or dissolve into the water, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:25
So, what does that mean, looking at it, um, molecularly?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:30
So if we zoom in again, what that means is basically

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:33
The purple solid molecules are switching places with the liquid

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:41
blue water molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:42
Okay? So they're basically switching places. The water is, like, eating

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:47
at the crystal die.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:50
And as you can see, it forms, like, a little cloud.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:53
Um, as it starts to dissolve. So that's diffusion happening. It's diffusing

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:59
out into the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:02
Um, the water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:03
And then eventually, over time, equilibrium has to be achieved. So now, here, if we zoom in,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:09
We have equal amounts, um, or not amounts, but equal kind of concentrations of the purple and the blue. So the

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:19
uh, water kind of turns, like, a lighter purple, as we kind of combine the colors of the dark purple and the clear, or the blue.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:26
Okay? So, what this means for cells is basically saying that

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:31
it doesn't require any, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:37
Molly, any extra molecule that doesn't require any extra

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:40
um, proteins or anything like that, diffusion basically just passively

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:46
goes in between the plasma membranes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:49
Until there's an equilibrium that's achieved with whatever the substance is. Of course, this isn't all substances that this is gonna happen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:57
It's only certain ions or whatever it is, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:00
With this type of, um, passive transport,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:03
Basically, ions can just, uh, or molecules can just freely move throughout inside and outside of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:09
Until there is a, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:12
a kind of equilibrium or a balance there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:15
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:17
So that's diffusion. When you think of diffusion, you want to think about equilibrium.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:21
Things are going to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:24
you know, shift around until equilibrium is achieved.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:29
Next, we have facilitated diffusion. So this is similar to diffusion that we just went over, but instead of just passing over freely,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:37
It needs facilitation, it needs help to do this, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:42
So let's look at this image here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:44
This is the plasma membrane, right? You see the little, um, phospholipid bilayer here, the little heads and the tails, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:51
And you have this big protein. It's a carrier protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:54
Here we have the inside of the cell, and then on the blue on the left, we have the outside of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:00
So these are solutes here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:02
These are trying to get into the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:04
But they need a little facilitation. They need some help. They can't just flow through the plasma membrane like the smaller ions or molecules, um, that could do it with diffusion.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:15
So, facilitated diffusion, these solutes need to go into this carrier protein, so the carrier protein

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:22
kind of takes in these solutes, and then it spits it out into the inside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:27
Okay? It doesn't require any energy to do this, it just kind of slips through the carrier protein,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:35
Um, and moves it inside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:37
So, no energy needed, but it needs the help of something, and that something is the carrier protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:44
to push it inside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:09
Okay, and then lastly, we have osmosis. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:13
Um, this is the third type of passive transport. Again, no energy is required.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:18
And with osmosis, I want you to think of water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:22
Osmosis is the diffusion of water, so it's kind of like a…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:26
a type… a way of… a type of diffusion, but it's specifically the diffusion of water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:32
The solute, or the substance, is not moving, but the water is moving.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:37
So, it's the diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane, which is the plasma membrane,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:43
From an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:49
Right? So, the water is moving from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:58
I'll… I think in the next slide,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:00
Yeah, in the next slide, I'll show you some more biological examples that will help this make a little bit more sense. But for now, just know

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:07
For osmosis, it's a type of passive transport where the water is shifting from either inside or outside of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:17
In order to kind of accommodate for whatever substances are already in there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:22
And how they do that is the water moves

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:26
from an area of higher concentration, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:30
Um, it depends if it's inside or outside the cell, where there's a lot of sub… a high concentration, like a strong concentration,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:38
of whatever substance it is,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:40
it moves from that area to the lower concentration, so it removes the water from that area.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:46
Okay? Higher concentration to lower concentration.

[Juan Santos] 18:45:53
Is that what they use on the water filters?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:58
Oh, the water filters, they do reverse osmosis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:01
Yeah. I don't know the process of reverse osmosis, but you're right, it's the same name.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:07
I should look into that. I'll check that out. I'll let you know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:10
Um, so here we have the effect of osmosis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:14
on our cells. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:17
There's 3 different types of solutions that our cells could be in, and at the top here, we're going to be looking at red blood cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:25
And at the bottom, we're going to be looking at plant cells, okay? So it just happens in living cells, not just humans.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:32
Or, you know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:34
you know, animals, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:36
So, the first we have are isotonic solutions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:39
So, this is where the cell does not gain or lose water, so they're just normal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:44
Okay? ISO and isotonic means the same as. So the concentration…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:50
of, um, the solute.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:53
for the substance.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:55
is the same on the inside of the cell as it is on the outside of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:00
Okay? And then we have hypotonic solutions, that's this guy in the middle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:07
So, with the red blood cells, the cells are swelling, and they're bursting. They are filled with water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:14
And the plant cell, it doesn't burst because it has that strong cell wall around it, but you see how thick it is?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:22
it got very enlarged with water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:25
So, hypotonic solutions, the cells are going to gain water because hypo… in hypotonic,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:32
means less than.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:33
So, the concentration of the solute, or the substance,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:38
in the cell is less than that of the outside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:43
So the concentration of… let's just say for all these examples, let's talk about salt, okay? Let's just say salt.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:49
So the concentration of the salt

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:52
Inside the cell is gonna be less than the outside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:56
And based on osmosis, we know that air… that water goes from

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:01
Um, areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. So if there's, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:08
a lower concentration of salt on the inside of the cell, the water is gonna go to it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:14
Right? So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:17
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:18
that's why these cells burst. That's why they get so big.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:24
And then the opposite effect for hypertonic solutions, that this… that's the last one here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:29
You have these shriveled-up cells. Everyone always asks me, what does shriveled mean? Um, this is an example question, by the way. The word shriveled is usually…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:39
Um, talking about hypertonic solutions, shriveled.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:43
shriveled, as you can see, they're kind of, like, shrunken. They're kind of, like, smaller. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:49
think about, like, you know, a little old lady.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:52
Whenever you hear that, like, she shriveled, like, she's kind of small, like, her skin is like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:57
you know, a little softer, a little saggy. Like, older people, you know, they're just a little more shriveled, they shrunk a little bit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:04
Um, so they're just a little bit smaller and, like, wrinkled, you can think of like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:10
And then, similarly, with the plant cells here, um, all of the insides have kind of dehydrated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:16
So, there's no… there's not much water here. There's some, but there's not much water here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:22
So, hypertonic solutions, hyper means the cells are losing water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:27
So, hyper means more than, and when I say more than, we're talking about the concentration of the solute inside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:34
So again, let's think about salt.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:36
So, in these red blood cells, or this plant cell,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:40
The concentration of salt inside the cell is more than the outside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:44
That means the outside has less, so the water is gonna go to the area where there's less, right? So that means all the water is gonna get out of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:52
And that's why they're all shriveled up.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:56
Does that make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:59
Does everyone see these examples? You might have to think about it a couple times in your head to try to

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:04
Make sure that you have these right, um, especially these two.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:07
But just remember the definition of osmosis and how it moves water moves from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:18
Okay? And that should help.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:24
Okay. Now, we're gonna move to active transport. So we finished with passive transport, we did those three types.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:33
Now we're in the overall scheme, we're looking at the second type.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:36
active transport. This is where energy is required.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:40
Okay? So, active transport is when molecules or ions move through the plasma membrane,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:48
against the concentration gradient.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:51
So they're moving from a low concentration to a high concentration.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:56
So that's not how things normally flow. Just like we saw for water, for osmosis, right? Water's gonna move from an area of higher concentration

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:05
to lower concentration.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:07
But now, with active transport,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:09
We're seeing that the molecules are moving against the concentration gradient, so they're trying to move from areas of low concentration

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:18
into areas of really high concentration, so they're trying to get into the really busy, packed areas. And that's not really natural.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:26
So we need energy,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:28
like ATP, to force their way through.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:32
Okay? And an example of that is the sodium-potassium pump in our bodies, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:37
That's just an example. Okay, let's look at this image here. This should help you guys

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:42
kind of figured out, and I have a little metaphor that maybe will help some of you. Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:46
So, here we're on the outside of the cell, and it has low concentration of this solute, right? You see these little yellow things? That's the solutes, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:56
And we're trying to get into the cell. And you see how inside the cell, there's a lot of solute? It's already very full.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:03
For example, you can think about this…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:06
If you're going to a bar, or to a club, or to a restaurant, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:13
You are standing outside, where there's not that many people, but you want to go inside to the bar, the club, the restaurant, whatever it is,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:21
Where it's busy, it's packed, you want to go in the restaurant, or you want to go inside the establishment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:27
But, it's so busy and packed in there that you don't fit. They're not gonna let you in, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:32
So what do you have to do

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:34
In order to get into the club, or the bar, or the restaurant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:38
Not that you really have to do this, but just for the metaphor,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:41
you pay the bouncer, or you…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:43
get a reservation, or whatever. You give some form of money,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:48
to put your name down, or to get into

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:50
the place. So, that is what these solutes are doing with the form of ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:57
So we have this transport protein, which is just the mechanism that's getting the solute in.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:04
But basically, you see this ATP here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:07
This solute is gonna pay this ATP, or pay with this ATP,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:11
to get shoved and forced into the inside of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:16
And here's the solute going into…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:19
the protein, and then it's on the inside. So then, because that ATP has been used, the currency has been spent, you paid the bouncer and they let you in,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:29
then this ATP, remember, once that energy is used,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:34
then it breaks off into ADP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:36
plus that phosphate group.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:39
Okay? So then that ATP is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:43
separated from that phosphate group and the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:48
energy is released. And then, now this solute is inside the cell, and we're good to go.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:52
Yes, Brandon?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:53:56
Yes, I'm sorry, could you elaborate on that a little bit more? How, um, transport protein pays, uh, with ATP to go out into the cell?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:06
For sure. So that's kind of, like, the metaphor part of it. It's not that the… the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:11
Solute is actually paying for it, but the cell is paying for it. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:16
Basically, these solutes…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:20
These, um, substances here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:22
they cannot get into the cell without help, because the cell is already full.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:29
So, in order to

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:31
push those solutes inside, they need the help of ATP, kind of like a vacuum, to suck it through this

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:39
Protein to force its way into the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:42
to get more of this solute into the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:46
So ATP, that energy that's being used,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:49
is used to, like a vacuum, suck the solute into this protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:55
And then, once it goes into the protein, then it can go into the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:59
Does that make it a little bit more clear?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:01
You have to use this ATP, the energy, you have to use the energy, kind of like a vacuum, to get the solute into the protein and then into the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:11
That was a different metaphor, but maybe that helped too. Does that make sense, Brandon?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:55:14
Yeah, that was… that was honestly very helpful. But, uh… How does… so… okay, it's inside, or I can see it's going through, but how… how does the ADP get formed? Is that just when it loses its energy, or… or what?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:17
Awesome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:29
Exactly, so ATP,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:31
Um, if you remember a couple slides back when I talked about ATP, ATP

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:36
Once the phosphate group, one of the phosphate groups, pops off,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:41
then it becomes ADP in the middle here, it becomes ADP plus the phosphate group.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:47
So, ADP means adenosine diphosphate, so there's two phosphate groups.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:52
And it had the third phosphate when it was ATP together, adenosine triphosphate, it had the 3 phosphates, but because that phosphate group popped off and the energy was released,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:03
Now it became the two separate things. So that's, like, the ATP cycle I was talking about with the phosphate popping off,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:10
And it becoming just the two ADP and the phosphate group, and then when the

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:16
When they come back together, then that's when ATP forms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:18
Does that make sense?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:56:21
Yes, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:23
Cool. Antonella, did you have your hand raised?

[Antonella Diaz] 18:56:26
Uh, yes, um, so ATP will only be found inside of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:32
Yes, in this example for active transport, yes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:40
Okay. Any other questions?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:42
Does that make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:47
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:55
Okay, and then the last one, the last thing for today, is bulk transport. So sometimes we're trying to bring in

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:03
molecules or substances that are too big, and they don't fit in the lysosomes, they don't fit in the proteins that are in the plasma membranes, they just cannot go through this plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:17
Without any help. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:20
Um, we call those macromolecules, because macro means big, right? They're big molecules. They're too big, and you can't move them with proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:29
Um, so they have to come in and out a different way.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:33
Two examples of this is exocytosis,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:36
Which is the top, and endocytosis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:40
XO means things going out, endo means things coming in.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:44
But the first one, exocytosis,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:46
That's when the secretory vesicles, if you guys remember from Chapter 4,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:51
The vesicles are inside the cell, and they…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:55
capture things, right? They're like little, uh, trucks or little cars. They're like little transport

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:01
vesicles. And, um, their secretory vesicles, because they secrete things.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:07
in and out. But anyway, these vesicles

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:11
Can someone tell me what are these vesicles made out of? What's the outer boundary made out of?

[Gabriela Quintiliano] 18:58:17
Forcefully peed by… by layers

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:18
Mm-hmm. Exactly. They're made of a phospholipid bilayer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:23
So you have these big molecules, these macromolecules,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:27
That is inside this vesicle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:29
And how does the vesicle get rid of it outside of the cell?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:33
The vesicle, since it's made of a phospholipid bilayer, it can merge with the plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:40
And it can help to release these molecules. Do you guys see that in the image?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:45
how the plasma membranes, um, merges with this phospholipid bilayer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:51
And once these, you know, move out of the way, like you see right here on the far right,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:56
the macromolecules can exit the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:59
So, exocytosis, exo, like exit, they're leaving.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:05
Cytosis, um, anything with cyto is talking about a cell. So you're leaving the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:12
And then literally the exact opposite, endocytosis. Endo, you're enduring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:17
So, these macromolecules are coming into the cell. These molecules are too big,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:22
And the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:26
vesicle is basically forming, it is being formed around this big molecule because it is made from the

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:33
pause, um, from the phospholipid bilayer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:36
part of the plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:40
Does everyone see that? And now you have a vesicle. So now we're bringing in these macromolecules into the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:48
Okay? So, exocytosis…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:52
It's leaving with the macromolecules, endocytosis, it's bringing it in.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:57
And the key here is that these vesicles that are carrying these big macromolecules

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:03
They are merging with the plasma membrane, or forming from the plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:10
That's how you can bring things in and out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:12
So that's bulk transport. You're bringing big, bulky things, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:18
Okay, so that's it, but this slide is a good little summary slide. Um, I would recommend drawing it in your notes. Um, basically it goes over all of the types of

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:30
cell transport that we just went over.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:33
Um, diffusion is here, just goes through the plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:37
Here we have water going through this, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:43
protein through the membrane, but it's honestly, you can think of it like, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:48
water, just think of it like osmosis going through.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:51
Here you have facilitated diffusion,

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:54
And then here you have active transport, so those 3 were passive transport, and then here you have active transport, where ATP is necessary.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:01:02
And then over here on the right, you have bulk transport.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:01:06
So, the reason this is, um, osmosis…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:01:10
Just to point out, the special protein is called an aquaporin, aqua, like water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:01:16
And that's how water molecules are able to move in and out of cells. It's a special protein. You don't have to remember that, but just so you are not confused when you see this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:01:26
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:01:29
Okay, anybody have any questions?
