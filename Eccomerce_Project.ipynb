        "# Introduction\n",
        "In a startup environment, where agility and rapid decision-making are essential, the ability to harness data for strategic insights can be a key differentiator. However, many startups, driven by the urgency of day-to-day operations, often overlook the potential of their own data. Critical questions—such as which products are driving sales, how pricing strategies impact profitability, and which product combinations resonate most with customers—can remain unanswered without a structured approach to data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recognizing this opportunity, I initiated a project aimed at transforming our raw sales data into actionable insights. By systematically collecting and organizing transaction data, I was able to build a comprehensive database that captured key details such as product SKUs, vendor information, pricing, and customer preferences. Using this database, I created interactive dashboards that allowed our team to visualize trends, forecast demand, and optimize product offerings and pricing strategies. The result was a more informed, data-driven approach to decision-making that directly supported the company’s growth objectives.\n"

        "# Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this project is to leverage transaction data to drive strategic insights and optimize various aspects of the business. Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Analyze On-Time Delivery Performance**: Evaluate the relationship between `shipDate` and `delivery_date` to assess on-time delivery performance. This analysis will help identify any delays in the shipping process and their impact on customer satisfaction, leading to better logistics planning and improved customer trust.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Understand Customer Purchase Behavior Based on Timing**: Analyze `orderDate` and `DeliveryDate` to understand customer purchase behavior, particularly around key holidays such as Christmas, Valentine’s Day (Vday), and Mother’s Day (Mday). Identifying trends in last-minute orders will enable the company to better prepare inventory and marketing strategies for peak periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimize Inventory Management**: Track `sku`, `quantity`, `unitPrice`, and `productId` across orders to forecast inventory needs more accurately. This will prevent stockouts or overstock situations, ensuring that the right products are available when customers need them.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Improve Financial Reporting and Profitability Analysis**: Analyze `orderTotal`, `amountPaid`, `taxAmount_x`, and `shippingAmount_x` to assess profitability for each order. This will help in refining pricing strategies and cost management, ultimately improving the company’s bottom line.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) per Product**: Calculate the LTV for each product by analyzing repeat purchases and the total value of orders associated with each `sku` over time. This will guide marketing efforts, product development, and customer retention strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Enhance Customer Segmentation and Personalization**: Use `customerId`, `shipTo.city`, `shipTo.state`, and `shipTo.postalCode` to segment customers based on geographic location and purchasing behavior. This will enable more targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Monitor Order Status and Lifecycle**: Track `orderStatus` to understand the progression of orders through different stages (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered). This will highlight inefficiencies and areas for process improvement, ensuring smoother order processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Optimize Warehouse and Store Operations**: Analyze data from `advancedOptions.warehouseId` and `advancedOptions.storeId` to evaluate the performance of different warehouses and stores. This will help optimize inventory distribution and reduce shipping times, enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Identify High-Value Customers**: Use transaction data to identify customers with the highest order totals (`orderTotal`) and frequency of purchases. This will allow the company to focus retention strategies on these high-value customers, maximizing long-term profitability.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Evaluate Seasonal Sales Trends**: Analyze `orderDate`, `sku`, and `quantity` to identify products that sell best during specific seasons or holidays. This insight will inform marketing campaigns and inventory planning, ensuring that the company capitalizes on peak demand periods."
