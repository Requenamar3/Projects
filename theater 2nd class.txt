[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:15
What you're seeing are a series of actions and events

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:20
that unfolds.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:22
which moves the plot forward.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:30
Why is it event after event after event?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:35
Because it's actionable.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:37
The actors…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:41
have actions to complete.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:45
Alright? So again,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:48
Playwriting.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:51
Drama, tragedy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:53
comedy. Broadway theaters.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:56
When you see Hamilton,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:49:58
or wicked, or Phantom of the Opera, or The Lion King.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:02
They are actions and events

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:06
that unfold in front of the audience, alright? So why is this concept of understanding

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:12
theater are events so important? Because, guys, you have to know the difference between dramatic writing

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:20
And narrative writing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:24
When you read a novel,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:27
um, fiction, non-fiction,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:30
There's something different about it. What's the difference between narrative writing as opposed

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:37
too dramatic writing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:41
What does… when you read a novel, what does a novel have?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:48
The dramatic writing does not.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 08:50:54
a narrator?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:55
Very good, Daphne.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:50:57
a narrator, that's why it's narrative writing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:01
Right? There's someone telling you

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:05
The plot, telling you the story,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:08
And then it's interjected…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:12
with characters…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:15
Um, speaking dialogue.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:19
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:21
So when I ask you on your midterm, what's the difference between dramatic writing and narrative writing,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:29
The answer is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:32
Dramatic writing, playwriting, theater,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:36
is event writing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:39
It's a series of events and actions.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:43
And narrative writing, like a novel,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:49
has a narrator.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:51
Just like Daphne said.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:51:55
Because you remember, in your English classes, you went through point of view.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:00
Right? Remember that?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:02
First person, second person, third person.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:05
That's who's speaking and narrating the novel.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:10
That doesn't happen in…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:12
dramatic writing. They're just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:14
actionable events. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Everybody got it?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:24
So let me keep reading the Aristotle's definition of plot. Refers to the series of actions and events

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:35
that unfold in front of the audience.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:38
opening scene.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:42
obstacles.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:44
Complications!

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:47
Crisis!

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:50
Climax!

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:53
And then… resolution.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:52:59
Um, okay, in the opening scene, guys, in dramatic writing, uh, who do we meet?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:05
First, usually.

[Daniel Herzog] 08:53:08
The main

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:10
Yeah, and what is he called?

[Daniel Herzog] 08:53:15
Protagon

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:16
Very good. Protagonist.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:19
So then, as Aristotle said,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:23
obstacles occur, complications.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:26
Problems, crises.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:28
Who's creating all of these problems for the protagonist?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:41
What's his name? What do we refer to him as?

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 08:53:47
I think it's the antagonist.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:48
Right. The very good, Dorcas, very good Melanie, the antagonist.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:53:58
So we have…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:01
say, in Shakespeare, Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:05
Which we're going to be reading.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:10
He is the protagonist.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:16
Then the antagonist, Iago, comes along.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:19
And causes Othello

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:22
all kind of crises.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:24
all kind of obstacles.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:27
all kind of complications and problems.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:31
So what does Othello have to do?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:35
He has to solve

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:37
These obstacles, try and overcome them.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:40
And by figuring

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:43
how to solve these problems, it moves the plot along.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:47
Pretty easy. You guys get it?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:53
Any questions on plot?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:54:59
Dramatic writing, actions and events happening up on the stage,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:03
you have the protagonist and the antagonist, and the protagonist is trying to overcome

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:10
And, like, sort of jumped through the hoops, you could think of it that way.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:15
of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:17
Overcoming the obstacles, the complications, and the crises, and all the other problems.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:24
that the antagonist

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:26
has cause. So now there's a conflict.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:29
All right? Okay, so that's PAW.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:33
Next up the pyramid is character. Well, we all know what characters are.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:41
Um, if we look at Aristotle's definition,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:44
It says…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:47
Excuse me. Refers…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:51
to the agents,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:54
of action.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:55:57
There's that word again, action, or events, so we can even say refers to the agents of the events.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:05
That unfold the plot.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:09
one decision at a time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:13
And there, in parentheses, you see protagonist, antagonist,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:17
And there's chorus in there, because…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:21
Aristotle wrote this…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:23
you know, during the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:27
Greek times, so they had choruses, alright? We don't use them too much.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:32
Today, at all.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:34
Uh, okay, again, character… agents of actions that unfold the plot.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:42
One decision at a time. So here's my question, guys. If he's saying characters have to decide something, one decision at a time,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:51
What's the character trying to decide?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:56:59
What does the protagonist have to make a decision on?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:05
One decision at a time as the plot goes forward. What's he trying…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:10
to achieve? What does he have to make a decision on

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:15
over and over again.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:26
He has to make a decision

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:29
makes one decision at a time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:31
how to overcome

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:34
the obstacles.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:38
The protagonist has to decide

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:41
do I…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:45
solve this…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:47
complication by going left,

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:49
Or do I go right? What do I do?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:53
He makes a choice.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:57:57
The plot moves forward.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:03
Then there's another obstacle.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:07
protagonist has to decide, okay, what do I do here? Do I…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:11
choose A, or do I choose B, or do I choose C?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:15
So, the protagonist is making…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:18
Decisions one at a time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:24
And by doing that, it makes it…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:27
the plot move forward.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:29
as Othello's trying to figure out, what do I do? What do I do? What choice do I make?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:36
Alright? Any questions on character, guys?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:45
Uh, okay, let's go up to, um, theme.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:53
What's theme, guys?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:58:59
Look, guys, I'm gonna have to…

[Valentina Pacheco] 08:59:01
Um, what this story's about?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:02
cut… what?

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 08:59:02
be the main

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:06
One at a time. Would you say?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:11
Go ahead. Again, what is a theme?

[Valentina Pacheco] 08:59:18
what this story is about?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:20
Valentina, yes, what's… um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:23
Yeah, what the story's about…

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:28
More so than that. Take it one step further, Valentina. What's the theme?

[Daniel Herzog] 08:59:36
its message, like, it's a universal message.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:38
Very good. Thank you, Daniel. What's the message?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:42
Just what Daniel said. What's the universal message?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:47
Next question.

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:52
Whose message is it? Who is… where is that voice coming from?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:56
Daniel, do you know?

[Holly Ricciuti] 08:59:59
Who's trying to teach us the lesson? Is it the characters?

[Daniel Herzog] 09:00:06
Something as the plot goes on, that's what the public's trying to teach us from the plot.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:07
Who's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:10
Right, so the theme, guys, comes from the writer, the author, the playwright.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:17
Shakespeare.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:19
All right? So the theme is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:23
The lesson, the message that the author is trying to teach us.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:29
All right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:33
Good job, guys. So let's look to the left.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:41
and see what…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:45
theme is.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:47
to the left.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:50
refers to the subject matter

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:53
And universal message, just as Daniel said, that word, universal,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:00:59
message, as supported by the unfolding of the plot and the development of the characters.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:07
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:09
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:11
Next question. Daniel said it's that universal message, which is perfect, because that's exactly what Aristotle says.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:18
What does that mean, universal?

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:01:26
That anyone could understand?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:28
anyone. We all can relate to it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:31
And make note, guys, it doesn't matter

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:34
If you're in the United States of America,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:38
or you're in the United Kingdom,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:40
Um, it's universal. We could all understand and relate to it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:47
It's the same…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:50
human need, human fear, human element.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:53
Okay, that's universal.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:01:56
All right, so we've covered plot character theme.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:04
Let's go up to diction. Diction's very important, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:09
But it's… well, let me take that back. It's middle of the road, you can see, because…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:15
Aristotle puts it,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:16
in the middle. So, diction dialogue. Before I read the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:24
definition in yellow.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:26
What is diction dialogue, guys?

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:02:34
the way they express it in the scene?

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 09:02:38
this style.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:38
Mm-hmm.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:41
Very good. How they communicate, how they use language, how they speak,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:47
All right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:50
the words they choose to use.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:54
So,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:02:57
If I read the defini… Aristotle's definition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:01
He says regarding ditchant dialogue,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:04
Refers to how the unfolding of the plot…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:10
The development of the characters…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:12
And the revelation…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:15
of the theme,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:20
are all that… are all manifested

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:24
with the written…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:28
texts of the script.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:31
And in parentheses, he says word choices, rhetorical devices, etc.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:37
So here is an important question.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:45
How does diction and dialogue, and how the characters speak…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:53
And the words they use,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:03:56
They choose to use. How does that tell us about who they are?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:01
And give us insight into

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:06
their characters, who they are.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:15
I would say that you are able to see what maybe the social status

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:20
Uh, the way they talk, the work they use.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:24
uh… uh…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:26
kind of give you an idea of what they are socially.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:29
Could be, right? Could be.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:30
Very good, Martha.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:33
Excellent.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:34
the two. Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:35
What?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:36
Even the emotional state of the person, right? The tone of voice.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:42
Right.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:43
And the way they talk.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:45
Uh, tells you even…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:04:47
the psyche, or the mental state of the person, emotional state of the person.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:52
Very good, very good, Martha. So it's giving us insight into the characters' emotional state,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:04:59
Their social status,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:01
We'll take it a step further. Their educational… their education.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:10
Their level of intelligence.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:15
If you're going to have a conversation with the President of the United States, it's going to be greatly different

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:23
That if you have a conversation with the kid that pumps your gas at a gas station.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:31
So, when we meet these characters,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:36
It's a whirlwind of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:39
wow, I know if this person is educated, if they're very wealthy,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:44
If they're middle class, if they're low class, if they are…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:50
you know, have…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:05:52
issues with drugs, issues with alcohol. Like, you get an understanding of who they are by how they communicate. It's the same

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:01
as it is as we live our daily lives.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:08
Um, let me think about some examples. Um, I don't know if any of you read… have any of you read Mice and Men?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:18
Okay, let's look at Harry Potter.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:25
We all know Harry Potter.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:27
So, we have those professors, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:31
Very well spoken.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:38
very eloquent.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:43
Would you say…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:45
I don't know all the professors' names in Harry Potter.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:48
But most of them, are they…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:06:51
upper echelon of society or not.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:06:57
I would say

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:00
Now, up, right? I mean, professors in general, because you know they have a certain level of

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:06
education, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:09
And then let's compare them to…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:14
I don't know, some… I'm thinking of someone in Harry Potter who's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:18
not that high class. I don't know, the…

[Daniel Herzog] 09:07:21
Hagrid?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:23
Yeah, sounds good. I don't know who that is. I'm thinking of that blonde kid that always causes trouble, the bully.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:32
In one of the episodes. I don't know, but you guys get my point, okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:36
Um, so that's one example. I'll tell you another example. Let's see, if I said, oh, Daniel…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:44
At precisely 10am, we are having tea time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:48
in the parlor, in the right wing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:07:53
So, it would be of your utmost importance that you show up

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:00
Because the Duke will be there in attendance,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:03
And we will be…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:06
having our…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:08
weekly assembly.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:14
That tells you I'm what?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:22
educated.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:24
Rich, aristocrat,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:28
Right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:32
Does everybody get it? It's very, very important.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:38
It also tells you

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:40
like, you get insight into…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:45
intelligence.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:47
Right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:50
That's why I mentioned the novel of mice and Men.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:54
very great American novel, guys. Unbelievable. It's by John Steinbeck.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:08:59
But another example of diction and dialogue is there's two characters, Lenny and George,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:06
And Lenny is, you know, a grown man in his 30s,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:12
super tall, 6'4",

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:14
But he can't put a sentence together.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:19
He would say something like,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:21
Yeah, da-da-da, that's a pretty dog kitty! Like, he can't…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:27
speak… he can't put…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:29
sentences together with nouns and verbs like the rest of us can.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:32
So he's got a learning disorder. He has a very low IQ.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:38
So that's another thing that you can learn from diction and dialogue, all right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:43
Um, so I think Martha and I covered it. Emotional state, social status, education.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:51
Um, education's big, guys, because you can tell right away when you're having a conversation with someone.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:58
how intellectual they are.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:09:59
Um, alright, everybody good with fiction and dialogue?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:08
Any questions on diction and dialogue?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:18
Oh, also, guys, if they have certain, um, accents,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:23
or nuances to the way they sound,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:29
That's gonna tell you where they're from geographically.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:35
Right? Of course, if they're Southern,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:38
They'll have a southern, maybe slight accent. If they're…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:43
New Yorkers…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:48
then perhaps they would have a New York

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:53
their addiction would be with that New York sort of, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:10:59
accent, alright?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:02
Um, alright, let's go up the pyramid. The last two, guys, and again, you see Aristotle…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:09
says these aren't too important.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:13
Alright, music melody, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:16
We all know what that is.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:21
Yeah, we all know what that is in terms of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:25
the theater, drama, mute, musicals, plays,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:31
tragedies, comedies, all right? It's sort of the bookend, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:37
Um, so Aristotle's definition of music melody is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:43
Refers to anything heard

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:46
From the performance space, instrumental music, songs,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:52
sound effects.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:54
volume of actors.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:11:56
Pauses, silences.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:00
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:02
Um, music.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:07
Any questions on music, guys? Is it necessary?

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:12:16
I don't think is necessary, but it does shape the energy of the scene.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:21
Yeah, very good, Yunette. Yeah, it's not… that's what Aristotle's saying. It's not necessary, but…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:30
Like Yunette said, it does shape

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:32
The scene…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:34
it bookends it, it…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:36
can give, like, a foreshadowing feeling.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:40
Um, it can give an element of suspense.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:44
Right? When you're watching Friday the 13th?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:47
And you hear that music?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:49
That's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:51
emblematic of those movies, the Friday the 13th movies.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:55
You start getting… oh my god, Jason's coming.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:12:56
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:12:58
Right? So, okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:01
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:03
And then, at the tippy-top, guys,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:08
spectacle.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:12
So what is spectacle?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:18
When I bring up the word spectacle,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:20
Think of spectacular.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:23
Alright?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:13:25
Yeah, the visual elements.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:27
The visual element

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:30
spec… what?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:13:31
You know, the special effects, or the lights…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:35
Very good. Special effects, lights.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:38
the… the spectacular element when you watch the Lion King.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:13:43
So, wow.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:44
Yeah, the wow factor, very good. It's also the Disney factor, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:49
Think of, um, Lion King with their, their costumes,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:54
And the lights in the back of, like, an orange…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:13:58
yellowish sunset…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:00
And… or think of Wicked, you know, the costumes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:04
The…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:07
flying around on the broom, up in the theater, up high, okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:13
Um, spectacle.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:16
And I will read in red what… how Aristotle defines it. It refers to anything seen…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:25
In the performance space.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:28
scenery, lights, costumes, makeup.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:30
The blocking and pacing of the actor's movement.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:33
Whatever makes it spectacular, like Martha said.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:37
the why, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:43
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:44
A couple examples off the top of my head, I mean, of spectacle. I always use the example Wizard of Oz.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:14:55
think of Dorothy's red shoes. Wow! They really stand out.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:15:02
The Yellow Brick Road, this beautiful, bright, like, glittery, eye-catching, yellow brick road.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:15:11
Um, I mean, there's so much spectacle in Wizard of Oz.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:15:15
Someone… you guys, try and come up with other examples off the top of your head of spectacles.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:15:29
What about in Hamilton? For those of you who've seen Hamilton, what would be some spectacle?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:15:45
Anybody seen Hamilton?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:15:52
I haven't seen it yet either, but I heard it's really good, and in terms of spectacle, what I've learned is that the stage…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:00
like, rotates.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:02
Right? So that's pretty spectacular.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:07
Um…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:16:08
I would say the most… I mean, in… for Hamilton, for me, the most impactful was the… the dance.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:17
Very good.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:16:18
Yeah.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:16:20
the way… and the singing, yeah, the rotation on there, but…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:16:24
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:25
The singing, the rotation of the stage, right?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:16:27
Yeah, that… it's like the… the whole story goes around, rotates, and that's how it comes.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:16:35
You know, there's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:35
Oh!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:42
Again, what about, um, Harry Potter?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:45
I mean, that's full of spectacle.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:48
Just the, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:54
I'm trying to think, what's the name of the, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:16:57
the big castle they go to.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:02
Where the wizards study.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 09:17:03
homeworks

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:04
Yeah. Well, they're called Hogwarts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:07
But I'm saying, look how spectacular

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:10
the… that castle is where they all go to study and learn, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:20
other…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:21
examples of spectacle.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:17:28
Maybe for me, the Lord of the Rings, the movie,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:32
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:35
Anything specific that jumps out to you?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:17:45
And there were so many, I mean, the costumes, the augers, the, you know…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:51
Yeah.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:17:53
Yes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:17:54
Um, yeah, exactly. Good example, right? I just thought of, um, Star Wars. Look at that. That's all so spectacular.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 09:18:01
Awesome, yeah, that one too, yeah.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:18:02
I wanted to add, I think the chant for one of the scenes was made by, like, a whole stadium of people. Like, he wanted to do it.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:18:10
through that, like, no echoes, like, no enhancing, just… he wanted it to be, like, real, like, 20,000, 30,000 people.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:18
in… in Lord of the Rings?

[Daniel Herzog] 09:18:19
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:21
That's good, that's a very good example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:25
Again, guys,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:27
So, Aristotle puts us at the top.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:32
How important is it, according to Aristotle? It's not.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:36
However,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:41
Audiences will pay…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:45
very expensive,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:47
ticket prices, because they want to see spectacle.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:51
They want to pay $150,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:18:55
to go see Wicked on Broadway, or The Lion King, because that's what they're paying for, they want that.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:02
Disney explosions.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:08
But it isn't…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:11
necessary Aristotle says.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:16
for the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:20
structure.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:21
And the… the plot.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:24
of the dramatic piece.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:26
Right? So guys, what are the most important

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:32
Well, I don't… let's pause, and then we'll get into the worksheets. I don't want to ask that question right now.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:38
We'll get into… we're going to take a break now, and then when we come back,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:44
Um, we're gonna look at worksheets.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:46
Regarding this, that asks specific questions like…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:53
Which of the six elements…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:19:57
is controlled by the playwright.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:01
Um, again, we'll ask…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:04
Can you have drama without…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:07
all of these elements, which we sort of just answered.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:10
But we're going to go through all these questions, we're going to work on the worksheets,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:14
I will show you what your module is.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:18
do next Saturday.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:20
So, it's 920, guys, let's take a 15-minute break.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:26
So, like, I'll see you at 9.35.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:20:29
Okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:07
All right, guys, we're back. Um,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:13
I just posted in chat two very important

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:20
terms that Aristotle defined

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:26
That are very important in theater, in drama, in movies.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:33
And any kind of a dramatic…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:36
piece of entertainment that you're writing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:40
All right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:43
So we're going to spend a little time…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:47
understanding what these two terms mean.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:51
And how they function,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:38:56
in dramatic writing. They're very important, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:00
So, if it's 9… it's 940 a.m., we'll probably spend

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:06
And our understanding these two terms.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:11
Okay,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:15
The terms are, number one, self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:24
And number two, catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:28
All right.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:31
Please understand, guys, that these two terms…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:35
Self-recognition and catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:40
are outside, obviously, of

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:43
Aristotle's Six Elements of Drama.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:46
Okay? So, we've already gone through the pyramid.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:51
of the elements of drama.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:54
Self-recognition and catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:58
are two terms

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:39:59
that Aristotle defined and explained in his book, The Poetics,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:04
that are integral

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:07
into dramatic writing. Okay, let's take…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:11
a first look at the term

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:14
Self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:18
All right? So what is the concept of self-recognition

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:24
in dramatic writing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:28
It really, guys, is a phenomenon.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:30
And when I explain the concept,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:34
You will recognize it,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:36
And you'll say, oh, wow, yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:39
I get it. Aristotle's a genius.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:44
And the same thing with the concept of catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:49
Alright, guys, so self-recognition…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:55
is a concept

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:57
According to Aristotle,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:40:59
Where the hero.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:04
or the protagonist, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:07
of the dramatic peace.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:12
recognizes

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:13
or realizes…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:16
that he made a terrible…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:20
terrible mistake.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:27
And because of this mistake,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:31
It leads to a whole reversal

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:35
a fortune.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:38
it leads to…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:42
Destruction,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:44
And ultimately, death.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:52
in Germanic…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:52
pieces.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:55
in Netflix movies,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:41:59
in Broadway shows,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:02
in plays.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:04
dramatic plays.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:06
Alright, again, it's that self-recognition is the concept.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:12
of when…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:14
The hero or the protagonist makes the realization.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:19
That he screwed up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:21
He made a huge mistake.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:24
Here's the key. It's too late.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:30
can't be fixed.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:32
can't be made better.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:34
can't be changed. The mistake

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:36
was already made.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:39
too late to fix it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:46
Self-recognition leads to chaos,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:50
destruction, and ultimately…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:53
Death.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:57
All right, so let's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:42:59
take some time to think about this concept and think about an example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:05
You can provide to me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:12
It could be something you see on Netflix,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:19
HBO, a recent movie…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:22
It could be a musical you've seen, like Hamilton,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:27
or a Broadway show,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:30
or any other play or musical you've seen.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:40
Examples, guys. I want to hear examples of self…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:44
recognition. When the hero realizes he made a mistake,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:50
You can see it wash over their face,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:54
their physical body, you know that moment,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:43:58
That's the, oh my god, what have I done?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:02
too late.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:04
what follows next?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:07
It's destruction and death.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:10
We can look at…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:12
Again, Shakespeare, what we're going to read, Othello.

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:44:19
I don't know the name of the movie.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:21
Yep.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:22
Uh-huh.

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:44:22
But it was when they, um, brought back to life Superman.

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:44:27
Batman brought back to life Superman, and then he was somebody else, he wasn't him.

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:44:33
So I guess Batman…

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:44:35
It's like, why did I bring him back?

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:44:38
for this

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:42
Right. So…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:43
in that moment of self-recognition,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:46
like, what happens to his physical body when he realizes?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:44:52
And you see it in his face when he realizes he made a mistake.

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:44:59
I think you can see it again on all the characters, um, that helped, uh, I think it was Wonder Woman as well.

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:45:05
That helped during that time.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:08
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:09
So, folks, when the moment of self-recognition occurs, again, that the hero, the protagonist realizes he screwed up and made a huge mistake,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:19
You can see it!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:22
on their physical bodies, in their faces.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:26
When Othello…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:28
In Shakespeare's Othello.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:31
realizes…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:33
He made a drastic…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:37
mistake. He… he literally…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:41
almost like he's gonna throw up. I mean, his…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:45
upper body sort of hunches over.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:45:50
I mean, you could see it in his face, he's just like, oh my god, what have I done? What did I do? You see it?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:00
In the facial features, alright? The physical features.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:09
Self-recognition, guys. I want to hear examples of what you've seen

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:15
That you can describe to us that moment your hero or the protagonist realizes, oh my god, I made a mistake! No, what did I do?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:28
Too late.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:46:28
Or would, uh, Luke Skywalker find you out?

[Daniel Herzog] 09:46:30
Who his father was, Callan? I feel like that's a big one.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:32
Very good. Very good example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:36
Daniel, what do you see on his physical face?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:41
His physicality when he makes a realization, he screwed it up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:45
What do you notice?

[Daniel Herzog] 09:46:49
He's, like, very sad, and he's sad and angry at the same time, like, he can't…

[Daniel Herzog] 09:46:53
come to believe that his father is Dark Vader.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:46:59
But you see it in his eyes and in his face, right? It's like…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:04
There's a shift, there's a change.

[Daniel Herzog] 09:47:07
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:10
Excellent example. Who else, guys?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:14
What about, um, Walter White?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:19
You guys know who he is, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:24
from Breaking Bad,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:30
Other students have given me that example that…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:34
He realizes…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:39
how bad he screwed up in making drugs and meth.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:45
And it's too late.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:47
things get violent.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:50
people die.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:47:57
Other examples of self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:06
Take time and think. There's third… how many students do I have? There's 34 of you in this class.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:12
I want examples, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:15
Just take time and think.

[Abel Acosta] 09:48:17
In Romeo and Juliet,

[Abel Acosta] 09:48:19
When, at the end, they both drink their poison?

[Abel Acosta] 09:48:23
Like, one dies, and then the other realizes that they made a mistake.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:23
Very good.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:27
Perfect.

[Abel Acosta] 09:48:28
I think that Yulia realizes that.

[Abel Acosta] 09:48:32
pretending to be dead.

[Abel Acosta] 09:48:32
And now then dies because Romi is dead.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:36
Very good, Abel. Thank you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:38
He just gave Romeo and Juliet. That's a great example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:43
Huge mistake at the end.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:46
terrible. And what is the ultimate outcome?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:52
they both die.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:48:55
Excellent, Abel. Who else? Examples, guys.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 09:48:59
I will say Mike Beth.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 09:49:02
When he kills King Duncan.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 09:49:06
That's… he's unable to pray and has hallucinations.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:11
And when he kills King Duncan, do you see… and when he realizes that self-recognition, oh, God,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:18
You see it on his face and his physical body?

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 09:49:24
Yeah.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 09:49:28
He has paranoia and…

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 09:49:30
It's like breaking down

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:36
Very good example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:39
Other examples, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:52
self-recognition, when the protagonist, the hero, realizes he

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:56
screwed up too late.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:49:59
Sorry.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:05
You know, and he's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:08
in his inner mind, he's probably thinking,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:11
Oh my god, how can I go back and fix this? How can I make it better?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:17
what has happened?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:19
But it's too late to be fixed, guys. The damage is done.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:23
Um…

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:50:27
Um, I have one.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:29
Yeah.

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:50:30
In… in Spider-Man, when… when Gwen dies, the… his, like,

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:50:37
with Superman in the building, and she falls out of… and he tries to, like,

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:50:44
rescue her, and she doesn't…

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:50:46
She dies, so…

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:50:47
That, I think, was, like,

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:50:50
breaking point for him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:51
So, that moment of self-recognition, do you see it in his face? Do you see it, like,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:50:59
the… the physical change?

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:51:03
Yes, he completely breaks down and, like, fells and cries, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:10
Yeah.

[Valentina Pacheco] 09:51:10
that is not fixable.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:14
I know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:17
Guys, get it in your mind that these two concepts, self-recognition and catharsis, are not happy

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:23
concepts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:25
I mean, this is not a happy lecture. It's about… and we didn't even get to catharsis yet.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:31
It's about, you know,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:35
the fall of the tragic hero, when he realizes, oh, no.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:40
Oh, God.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:42
Right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:44
Good examples.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:46
Another example of self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:52
Well, getting back to Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:51:59
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:01
Opello, which we're going to read,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:04
Does anybody… has anybody read Othello?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:09
Okay, so guys, there are no spoiler alerts in Shakespeare, so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:15
you usually know what has to… what's happening, and you know the plot before you even read it, because the language is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:22
too complicated. So, in Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:26
He kills Desdemona, that's his wife.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:29
Why does he kill her?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:31
Because his best friend sets him up and says she's cheating.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:38
awful. She's not cheating. He's set up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:44
And the moment when he realizes that his best friend

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:50
lied. His best friend made this whole story up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:52:56
it's too late. He already killed her.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:02
And what follows is just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:05
Very tragic, because he can't…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:08
accept the fact. And again, you see it

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:13
in his eyes, the moment he realizes. I mean, he's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:17
He dies, he's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:20
heartbroken, because he killed his wife and his best friend lied to him, and he

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:25
He's just… all the air…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:28
comes out of him, and he's overridden with grief.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:33
And you see it in his eyes, in his face.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:37
that, oh my god, I… it's too overwhelming for him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:41
of a mistake.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:45
So he kills himself.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:50
Not a… not pleasant. Um, not a pleasant story.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:53:55
Um, other examples of self-recognition, guys, that you can think of when, again, the protagonist hero realizes he screwed it up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:05
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:22
Can any of you pinpoint

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:23
Any other? Maybe think of things you've watched on Netflix.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:30
When the villain, the hero, the protagonist realizes he screwed it up,

[Maria Medina] 09:54:39
Could it be, like, A Christmas Carol when Scrooge, uh, recognizes that, like, his actions and his selfishness, um, made him lowly?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:49
That's a good one.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:51
Yeah. Can you see it on his face?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:54:56
And in his physical form, when he realizes he's bad,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:12
That's a very good example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:16
Because now that you know what self-recognition is, and this concept,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:21
It's pretty phenomenal.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:28
you know, so tonight,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:30
when you're watching…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:33
Netflix. Sorry, guys, hold on.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:55:39
You just drop water all over everything in my computer.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:04
All right. Yeah, so guys…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:10
When you're watching Netflix tonight,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:17
And you see…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:22
The protagonist realizes he screwed up,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:25
And it's too late, now you know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:29
that that's Aristotle's concept of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:32
self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:41
Any other examples you can think of?

[Esmeralda Rosabal] 09:56:45
Uh, in the movie, the Lorax, when the one seller cuts the last three,

[Esmeralda Rosabal] 09:56:50
And then that's when he realizes he messed up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:56:54
I don't know that. It's called the Lorax.

[Esmeralda Rosabal] 09:56:57
Yes

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:00
That's a good example. Do you guys know… do the rest of you know what she's talking about?

[Yanet Sanchez] 09:57:05
Yeah

[Damian Jiron] 09:57:06
Yes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:11
Is that on Netflix?

[Esmeralda Rosabal] 09:57:13
Yes, it's in Netflix.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:15
That's a great example. So, can you see the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:18
Physical changes in the body and the facial features when they realize they

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:24
They screwed it up.

[Esmeralda Rosabal] 09:57:26
Yes, his entire faith changes, and the Loris tells him

[Esmeralda Rosabal] 09:57:30
well, now maybe you can realize what you have done.

[Esmeralda Rosabal] 09:57:33
And that's the moment he realizes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:40
Yeah. Oh, it's interesting, guys, I have a really good example for you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:46
All right. So, Aristotle defines this concept, he's Greek,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:52
So, one of the most important Greek playwrights

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:57:57
is Sophocles.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:00
All right? I don't think probably none of you have heard of him, but…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:04
Sophocles, very important

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:08
Greek playwright, tragic writer.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:11
He writes a very famous play called Oedipus Rex.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:16
Any of you know the story of Oedipus Rex?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:23
It's a bad story. Who is Oedipus? Why is he important?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:27
And what does it have to do with self-recognition? I'll tell you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:34
So, Sophocles writes Oedipus Rex. Oedipus…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:40
without knowing

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:43
murders his father.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:46
He doesn't know it's his father.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:50
But he murders him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:52
He marries…

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:55
His mother!

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:58:58
He doesn't know that's his mother.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:04
He has children.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:06
with his mother.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:10
All right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:13
So again, Oedipus Rex.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:15
Kills his father, marries his mother, has children with his mother.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:20
When he realizes that moment of self-recognition,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:28
is so overwhelming.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:30
for him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:35
That he… he… he cannot grasp this idea

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:39
That he murdered his dad, and his wife was his mother, and they have children.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:43
It's so overwhelming for him, and the pain is so immense.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:49
Did he takes a pin,

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:53
From his mother, wife's dress.

[Holly Ricciuti] 09:59:56
And he pokes his eyes out.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:01
And she hangs herself from a tree.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:05
it's, like, incomprehensible.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:08
to both Oedipus…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:11
And the mother, I guess, that…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:14
they got married and had children, and he killed his father. It's just a disaster.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:19
So, the point is,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:21
that moment of self-recognition can become so overwhelming.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:26
to the hero.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:29
that there's no escaping the pain,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:32
Until you… unless you…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:34
kill yourself, or do what Aristotle did. He pokes his eyes out because he can't bear

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:41
to look at his life.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:45
All right.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:00:51
Any other examples of self-recognition or questions about the concept?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:00:59
Right now that you mention that story, it reminds me of Game of Thrones, when Jon Snow found out that was… Daenerys was his aunt.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:01:08
And he was in love with her.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:09
Oh, I don't know.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:10
Oh, God.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:12
You guys know what she's talking about?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:19
So he falls in love with his aunt.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:01:24
Yes. And she did as well.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:25
Oh, no.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:01:28
I think towards the end of the seasons, um, that's when they found out they were related.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:29
So…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:37
And what's the, uh, reaction?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:44
The physical, physical reaction.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:47
When they realized, when he realizes,

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:01:50
Uh, he killed her?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:01:53
Yep, see?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:01:57
Because he realized he was, um…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:01:59
He had made a mistake of falling in love with her, I guess.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:05
Yeah. So you see how severe…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:10
and dangerous, and tragic self-recognition is.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:15
I mean…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:17
The whole plot…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:19
Everything is centered around that moment of self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:25
Because why? It leads to the ultimate

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:30
the alternate.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:33
grave situation, which is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:35
death.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:38
That's a great example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:42
Um, any other questions?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:47
Or examples of self-recognition, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:50
Is it all clear to you, the call… Aristotle's concept?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:02:53
how it functions in Germanic writing,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:06
Any questions, guys?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:15
All right, and if no questions, let's go on to…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:18
The second concept of Aristotle.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:24
Um, just like self-recognition, when I explain to you catharsis,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:30
Again, it's just a phenomenon, and you will recognize it

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:36
And you will think, oh, wow, yeah, now I get it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:39
So what is catharsis, guys?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:44
Catharsis…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:50
Is Aristotle's concept

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:03:56
of when the audience…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:01
you guys, when you're watching Star Wars, when you're watching Game of Thrones, when you're watching these

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:10
dramas unfold, the catharsis is when the audience

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:17
can't take it anymore. They're sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:20
They get a purging of emotion.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:24
of what they're seeing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:28
they feel trauma.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:30
They feel pity.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:34
They feel fear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:39
Disgust.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:43
sick to your stomach kind of feeling.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:45
That's why Aristotle says it's a purging, you're… you're…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:50
you're sick, you're disgusted, you have a fear and an overwhelm, and oh my god.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:57
And then…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:04:59
Once you feel that, and you purge it,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:05
then you accept it,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:09
And you accept how bad it is, and traumatic it is, and then the resolution follows.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:18
Catharsis, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:23
The purging of the audience's emotions.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:36
So, when I watch Othello,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:43
And I see him…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:48
screaming and yelling.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:50
act as Zimona, and accusing her of cheating.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:55
And he says, I'm going to kill you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:05:59
And…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:03
this poor woman is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:06
terrified, and she loves him so much, and she's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:09
trying to convince him I didn't…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:11
didn't… I wasn't… I did not…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:14
cheat. I was not unfaithful.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:16
Please don't kill me, please don't kill me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:19
And he just proceeds, and he kills her.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:24
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:27
smothers her with a pillow in her bed,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:31
My catharsis is… I feel…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:34
anxious, I'm really angry.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:39
like, my hands start to shake because I want to scream at him and go, leave her alone!

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:46
This is thickening!

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:50
to watch this woman being abused and battered and tormented, I can't take it. Like, I can't…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:06:56
I can't cope. So that's my…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:00
personal catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:02
sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:05
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:08
Very important concept.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:09
you have all experienced it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:12
You just didn't know that that was Aristotle's

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:19
concept in tragedies, in dramas.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:30
in Macbeth.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:36
right in the first scene, when he goes and kills, and

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:40
shoves a dagger

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:45
into…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:50
His friend's heart, I can't… like, I… I just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:55
It's very upsetting to me. I feel sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:07:57
All right, so this concept, again,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:01
Catharsis. The audience is purging of emotions.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:06
of pity, of fear, of overwhelm, of disgust.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:11
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:13
that kind of feeling.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:20
critically important. And remember, guys, it has nothing to do with the characters.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:25
This is on the audience.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:29
It's your reaction

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:32
your feeling of disgust,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:34
and pity, and fear.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:38
and disbelief, and overwhelm.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:42
So, take some time and think about catharsis. I want to hear examples.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:47
of what you saw,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:51
Whether it's, again, a movie,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:55
Film, Netflix…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:08:58
drama, uh, you know, a play, a musical.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:03
Okay? So take some time, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:08
I want to hear examples, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:19
And how you felt.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:22
what were the emotions going through you?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:39
Um, what about Romeo and Juliet?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:41
I forget who brought Romeo and Juliet up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:44
But how did you feel

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:48
at the end,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:09:54
when you saw that Julie actually wasn't dead, she just took the poison.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:02
Did you have a catharsis? How did you feel about that?

[Abel Acosta] 10:10:06
Sort of frustrated.

[Abel Acosta] 10:10:06
Like, they messed it all up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:10
They messed it all up. You're frustrated, right?

[Abel Acosta] 10:10:11
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:14
You think to yourself, right, Abel, like, oh, damn, how could they screw this up, right?

[Abel Acosta] 10:10:21
Yeah, like, they almost… they almost were able to, like, be together.

[Abel Acosta] 10:10:25
But then they messed it all up by a misunderstanding.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:34
Yeah. It's a great…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:38
example of your catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:43
Other examples, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:45
I promise you, if you just think,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:48
Every single one of you has had that cathartic

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:52
Moment.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:54
watching…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:57
a dramatic…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:10:59
piece of art, either a movie,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:03
musical, play,

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:07
Lion King?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:08
When Scar, um, kills, practically kills his brother,

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:14
It doesn't help him go up.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:17
like, in disbelief that he killed his own brother, and then blamed Simba for it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:23
Yep, very good, Yunette. How did you feel?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:26
What was your catharsis? What were your emotions and feelings?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:32
that in a way that Simba, thinking he killed his own dad, or because of him, he went to rescue him, and mad at his brother, because…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:42
Only to get the… be the… the leader.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:46
He had to kill his brother just to be the leader.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:11:50
Yep. How'd you feel?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:54
I guess it was a really sad moment for me.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:11:57
It is… it… yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:00
You felt sad.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:12:00
I don't know. Yes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:02
Remember, guys, you, you, you always feel a negative emotion. Catharsis is not

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:09
happy. It's not joy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:11
It's a negative emotion.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:15
a negative psychological response

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:20
to viewing…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:21
what's going on in the dramatic piece.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:25
Very good, Yunette. That's a great example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:28
Uh, other…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:30
examples of your catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:44
I'll give you another example. I don't know if any of you saw…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:49
the movie The Lovely Bones, or read the book?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:55
sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:12:56
maybe sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:01
And I was really angry.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:07
And I'm sitting there watching this, thinking to myself, who would ever make a movie like this? This is just sick.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:15
So I had a negative, negative reaction, negative emotion, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:19
I also, you know, if I watch war movies,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:25
I have a really bad catharsic… cathartic moment where I… it's just, like, I…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:32
have to close my eyes. I don't like…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:37
you know, it doesn't… I just don't… I feel sick. It's too psychologically damaging to me, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:44
Again, catharsis dies. It arouses negative emotions in the audience.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:50
It's not pleasant.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:53
Um, other examples, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:13:58
Think.

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:08
In the movie La La Land, at the end, when you realize it was all…

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:13
it was all kind of made up. Um, you feel…

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:17
kind of, like, what if…

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:20
You know?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:22
Yeah, so hot, so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:24
So you felt, Camilla, like…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:14:28
Did you feel… how did you feel? What were your emotions? Did you feel confused, or…?

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:36
Definitely. It was, like, confusion with that pity, because you wish that for them, you wished their relationship for them, even though it never happened.

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:46
Um, and you're also, like…

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:48
it's… it's bittersweet, because they kind of look at each other from across the room, and…

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:54
you can see the emotion in their eyes.

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:57
But it was…

[Camila Urtate] 10:14:59
You know, they had broken up years ago.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:02
Yeah.

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:15:09
Professor, I have a question. So, I have a question. Does self-recognition can be the same thing as the catharsis?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:11
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:18
They work… that's a great question, Yannette. Self-recognition and catharsis work together.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:26
But self-recognition is a character

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:31
In the drama, either the hero, the protagonist, who realizes

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:36
He made a huge mistake,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:38
And as a result,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:42
the audience…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:44
has a cathartic moment. They have a negative emotional response.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:51
So they work together,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:54
But one is the hero.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:15:59
That self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:01
and catharsis is the audience.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:05
Does that explain it?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:16:07
Yes, thank you

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:12
So when you're watching Netflix, again, guys, when you're watching Netflix tonight, you're watching something

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:18
dramatic…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:24
try and identify

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:26
you know, those moments…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:28
Where you're having a very negative emotional response to what's happening.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:35
And you're purging all these

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:37
emotions, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:46
Again, identify

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:49
that moment of self-recognition, okay? So, tonight, whatever you're watching,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:55
identify. Self-recognition,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:16:58
And then identify catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:01
your purging of your emotions.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:03
That makes you feel really…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:05
not good. Other examples of catharsis, guys, that you've experienced?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:14
watching a movie, Netflix, musical…

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 10:17:31
Um, when I was watching Death Boy Society,

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 10:17:35
Um, and they did the revelation.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 10:17:39
with the kid that…

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 10:17:41
kill himself. I was like…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:43
Yeah.

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 10:17:44
Wow! That was very…

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 10:17:48
jaw-dropping for me, because I wasn't expecting it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:17:53
Very good, Daphne. I love that movie. So you were, like, sick, like, whoa, I can't believe it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:06
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:08
That's a great example.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:15
Um, in COCO, the Mexican movie…

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:20
Or the main character, I think it's Miguel Cole?

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:24
Or he basically starts sinking

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:24
Huh?

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:28
a song. So his grandmother.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:32
Because she was like, forget it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:32
What does he do? He what?

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:36
You're singing.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:37
Because her… his great-grandmother was forgetting.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:42
About her father.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:43
So it's like a Mexican tradition.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:46
for the date of death.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:18:47
Oh!

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:50
Yeah.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:18:52
And it was kind of sad. I always cry when that scene comes up.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:02
Yeah, that's a great example. So you were…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:07
like, crying and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:08
feeling very overwhelmed, right?

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:19:11
Yeah, because she was forgetting, and then somehow, with the song, she remembered everything.

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:19:18
Because her file used to be a singer.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:20
Yeah.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:38
I'll give you, um, another example. I mentioned

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:45
the novel of Mice and Men, that's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:19:48
And there's two characters. They made a movie out of it called A Mice and Men. It's one of the greatest American novels ever written.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:00
And what happens is…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:03
There's two characters, Lenny and George.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:06
And Lenny's very dumb.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:09
He has a very low IQ. I told you this earlier, when we were

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:12
talking about diction and dialogue.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:15
He's, like, a 30-year-old man who…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:19
has the inter… the intelligence of, like, a 3-year-old boy.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:25
And he…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:28
He ends up raping a woman and killing her puppies.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:33
He doesn't know. He shakes them to death.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:37
So the whole town…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:39
is chasing after Lenny, and they're gonna crucify him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:44
So George, his best friend,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:51
makes a decision and says, alright, Lenny, go walk in that field of flowers over there.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:20:59
You know, and they're best friends. George takes care of Lenny because he's…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:04
so many mentally incompetent. Again, he says,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:07
Just go take a walk in that beautiful field of flowers over there, and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:12
you know, go pick up some roses and smell them, and put them on your skin, and just go, Lenny, go.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:19
So, Lenny goes, okay, George,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:22
So Lenny's walking through this field of flowers, and George is saying, don't look back, Lenny!

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:29
Just walk through the flowers, whatever you do, don't look back, just keep going and walking through the flowers.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:36
What do you think George does?

[Abel Acosta] 10:21:42
Hey, Gilson?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:44
He shoots them in the head.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:47
It's his best friend. It was like…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:50
His little baby brother.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:21:52
Why did he shoot him in the head? Because he's gonna be crucified and tortured by all the people in the town.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:00
I cry. It's just…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:03
So… sad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:06
And he does, uh, the right thing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:09
Because he loves Lenny, and he knows if I don't kill you,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:14
they're gonna torture you and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:18
make a public mockery of you,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:20
So he sends them into a field of flowers and just says, keep going and never look back. And he says, okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:27
And he just pulls out his gun,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:30
And shoots him in the head. It's really unbelievable. I cry.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:35
But I don't cry because, I mean, it's sad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:38
but I cry because, like,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:41
the love that George had for him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:47
you know, he loved him so much.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:50
That as hard as it was to shoot him in the head, he knew he had to do it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:56
really bad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:22:59
So that's my catharsis. It's just like…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:03
You guys should see that movie.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:06
That's one of the greatest…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:23:07
What's… what's the name of the movie?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:09
It's of mice and men, and it's based on the novel of Mice and Men.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:16
By John Steinbeck.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:18
But it's… and it's a small novel, it's only, like, 100 pages.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:22
And it's one of the greatest American novels ever written, and they always teach it in high school.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:30
in the… it's interesting. In the northern states,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:36
of mice and men is always part of the curriculum for English classes.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:41
But now that I'm a resident of Florida State, I don't see it being red, which is interesting.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:48
Um, usually it's a mandatory high school reading.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:52
for everybody, and I know in all the northern states, because I'm from Pennsylvania,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:23:57
Like, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:01
All those northern… Ohio, all those states,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:04
On the other side of the country, it's mandatory.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:07
So, it's not in Florida.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:09
But anyway, it's a really great novel, and it's really heartbreaking, so that's another example of my catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:16
Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:19
Oh, I just thought… yeah, go ahead, and then I thought of another one. Okay.

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:24:19
We have one example.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:24
Valentino?

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:24:27
Um, so recently, I saw…

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:24:31
the movie of Queen, the band, Bohemian Rhapsody, and… yeah, and my guitarsis was when…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:35
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:24:40
like, after, um, he figures that he has, uh…

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:24:46
the…

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:24:49
Yeah… I don't know how to call it in English, I'm sorry.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:55
8? You mean the illness?

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:24:55
Yeah, AIDS, AIDS, I'm sorry.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:24:57
Yeah, and… yeah, he has a…

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:24:58
Um, so after that, he, like, tells the whole band, and to me, I was, like, crying horribly.

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:25:06
Just because he just figured that he had very few time left.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:13
So, Valentina, you were crying.

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:25:18
Yes, yes, I was crying, and…

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:25:21
Yeah, it was

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:25
So that's your catharsis, your…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:29
emotional…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:31
negative emotional, psychological response.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:35
to watching something dramatic, right? Great example, Valentina.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:41
Um, thank you.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:43
I'll tell you another example I just thought of. When I was mentioning of mice and men,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:49
I thought of the movie The Green Mile.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:52
Have you guys seen that?

[Camila Urtate] 10:25:58
No

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:25:58
Okay.

[Daniel Herzog] 10:25:59
Which one's that one? The green line?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:00
Oh, I'm sorry. No, what's it called? The Green Mile?

[Daniel Herzog] 10:26:04
Is it the one with the piano guy?

[Daniel Herzog] 10:26:07
And, uh, no.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:07
No, it's the one with the big… the big, very big black guy, who's also very dumb.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:13
He doesn't have… he's, like, has the intellect of, like, a 3-year-old.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:18
And he does really, really bad things, and they…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:22
electrocute him. Um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:25
I'm looking it up, hang on, I want to make sure I get the…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:28
Yeah, no, Tom Hanks is in it. It's called The Green Mile.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:34
awful. Uh, it's the same thing as what I told you about.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:38
of mice and men, there's a really, really

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:42
there's a man, and he's a black guy, and he's huge. He's, like, 6'5",

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:49
300-pound, but again, just like in… of mice and Men, he has

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:55
a very low intellect.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:57
So he's probably in his…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:26:59
30s, but he functions on the level of, like, a 3-year-old.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:06
And there's a scene…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:09
Where he kills these two little girls.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:13
But he didn't mean it. Like, he didn't know what he was doing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:18
And…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:21
he shook them.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:23
or did something, and they're…

[Abel Acosta] 10:27:25
Yeah. Professor in that movie, he doesn't kill the girls.

[Abel Acosta] 10:27:29
Somebody else does, and he gets framed for it.

[Abel Acosta] 10:27:33
And at the end, he dies because he doesn't want to keep living in this world anymore, because it's too dark.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:33
Oh!

[Abel Acosta] 10:27:37
And he asked the guards to kill him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:42
So, the scene where he's sitting there with those two little girls, you know the scene

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:46
And their blonde hair is all covered in red from the blood.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:27:51
He didn't actually kill them.

[Abel Acosta] 10:27:53
No, he got set up by…

[Abel Acosta] 10:27:56
by somebody else, because since he was black,

[Abel Acosta] 10:27:59
And they just put the line on him.

[Abel Acosta] 10:28:01
But he didn't do it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:02
I didn't know that!

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:04
oh my god, I have to… you know, because I just tuned in…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:08
I didn't watch it completely, you know, I'm gonna watch it again.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:12
But anyway, I had a huge catharsis when I saw him sitting there,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:18
you know, with the two blonde girls in his lap, and their hair… their blonde hair turned red and was caked with blood. You remember, Abel, he was sitting there crying and flipping out?

[Abel Acosta] 10:28:29
Yeah, he tried to save them, but he didn't.

[Abel Acosta] 10:28:32
Together in time, that was what I was crying.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:32
And… and…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:34
Okay, so I was just devastated. I was sick to my stomach. I felt sorry for him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:41
Because I thought that he did it, but just was not intelligent enough.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:46
But I hear what you're saying now.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:48
But, um…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:28:53
That is a movie where I had… did you have catharsis when you were watching that?

[Abel Acosta] 10:28:58
Yes. Especially at the end, because he gets abused so much.

[Abel Acosta] 10:29:04
He doesn't want to keep living and just kill him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:07
Yeah. And you know what? I'm looking…

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:29:09
He had a connection with one of the guards, right? Like, he would talk a lot to one of the guards in this movie?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:16
Yeah, I think that was Tom Hanks, Abel, was it?

[Abel Acosta] 10:29:19
Yeah, he took into his home, I think.

[Abel Acosta] 10:29:22
And, like, gave him food and everything.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:24
Yeah, they were like friends, right?

[Abel Acosta] 10:29:27
Yeah, because in the movie, he has, like,

[Abel Acosta] 10:29:31
uh… he has, like, powers given to him by God.

[Abel Acosta] 10:29:34
Like, he's an angel, and he kills Tom Hank's wife from, like, cancer, I think.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:36
Right.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:40
Right. And I'm reading about it, it probably may be able… does it take place in the South?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:50
where racism was… was really bad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:53
Because I'm reading here, it says, uh, the Green Mile addresses race,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:29:58
Morality and kindness through its setting of a depression-era

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:04
death row inmate. So, my assumption is it takes place in the South, but it doesn't matter, because

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:11
So they framed him

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:13
Because he was Black?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:15
Is that right?

[Abel Acosta] 10:30:19
Yes, because when they got to him, he was with the little girls, and they were dead.

[Abel Acosta] 10:30:23
So they just assumed he killed them.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:26
And he's… and he admitted it, even though he didn't do it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:32
Or does he say I didn't do it?

[Abel Acosta] 10:30:35
I think he says I didn't do it, but I just don't believe him.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:38
Unbelievable.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:40
I don't know, I'm…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:43
The movie is so upsetting to me, I'm not a big fan of it. What do you think, Abel?

[Abel Acosta] 10:30:51
I think it's a good movie.

[Abel Acosta] 10:30:53
like, it has a lot of good moments, but it's really sad.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:30:57
I know. I know.

[Abel Acosta] 10:30:57
for most of the characters.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:03
I agree with you, Abel. I mean, I see

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:07
dramatic works that are sometimes, like, so…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:11
so horrible from beginning to end that I think to myself, why do I have to even watch this?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:19
And I want to leave. I turn it off. I don't want to see it.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:23
You know, um, that's a great example, the Green Mile.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:27
Um, any other catharsis?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:47
We came up with a lot of really good… you guys did, came up with

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:52
came up with a lot of really good examples of catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:31:55
Do you all understand the concept?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:02
Any questions on catharsis?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:10
I hope you realize how important it is

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:16
in the… in… in dramatic writing, and how necessary

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:21
You know, it's part of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:24
tragedy. It's part…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:27
of…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:29
the brilliance of dramatic work and tragic writing.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:34
that you feel, as an audience member,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:38
this overwhelming negative emotional feeling.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:41
sick, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:43
Um, and then, of course, self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:48
They're… they're phenomenal. They're… they're like a…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:52
a literary…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:54
phenomenal concepts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:32:58
Right? And again, whatever you're watching tonight, try and identify. Oh, yeah, look.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:04
He's realizing he messed up that self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:07
Then you're watching, and you're thinking, oh my god, I'm just… I can't believe that just happened. I'm so sad. And then you start to cry.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:15
That's catharsis.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:19
Very, very, very powerful concepts. That's why we spent an…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:25
Guys, we spent a whole hour on self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:25
our…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:28
and catharsis. That's how important they are.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:32
And also, please make note, you have to understand

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:36
how to explain this to me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:38
Because on the midterm,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:41
I'm gonna say…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:44
Explain self-recognition.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:47
Explain catharsis, and you have to just be able to define it for me.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:33:55
Any questions? If not, we're going to take a break. That's a lot of information, guys.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:01
So, first hour, we went through the six elements of drama. Without looking at

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:08
the pyramid. Can you remember? What's first?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:12
What's the biggest one at the bottom?

[Daniel Herzog] 10:34:16
plot.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:17
Next.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:22
character, right?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:23
Am I right? Okay.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:25
And then, right, I always get those two mixed up, two and three.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:30
Then what's above character?

[Camila Urtate] 10:34:33
scheme

[Abel Acosta] 10:34:33
Theme

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:34
Right, perfect. So remember…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:36
The first three, very important.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:39
plot, character, theme.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:42
Then what are the next three?

[Yanet Sanchez] 10:34:46
Addiction dialogue?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:47
Excellent addiction dialogue, and then what is above that?

[Isis Sanchez] 10:34:52
music melody

[Melany Vinetnavarro] 10:34:53
Big Maddie.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:34:54
Music melody, and what's at the tippy-tippy top?

[Valentina Pacheco] 10:34:58
Inspector?

[Daphne Alvarez Gonzalez] 10:34:58
Spectacle

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:00
practical. You guys are so great.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:02
And we covered…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:04
catharsis and self-recognition. We spent a whole hour on those concepts.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:09
Guys, let's take a break, and then when we come back,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:12
We're going to go through the worksheets,

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:16
And I'll explain to you Module 1.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:19
And we'll finish at, like, 11… we'll be done by 11.30.

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:22
So right now, it's 1035…

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:27
come back in 15 minutes, so 10.50, okay?

[Holly Ricciuti] 10:35:33
Thanks, guys!
