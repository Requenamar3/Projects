[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:23
you have both of them if you need them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:26
Um, okay, so make sure that you watch that. Hopefully you watched it before class today, like I said, because the things that I covered in that chapter, some of them will be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:35
a little bit relevant for today, especially the phospholipid bilayer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:41
Um, so please make sure you watch that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:43
And I, uh, extended the homework assignment for Chapter 3

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:48
to be due, um, I think on Tuesday, the 16th.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:53
By 11 PM. So make sure that you get that done on time.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:58
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:43:59
Yeah, and then tonight, we're going to be going through Chapter 4.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:05
Um, let me find the PowerPoint…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:09
Let me know if you guys have any questions while I'm pulling this up.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:22
I don't want to download it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:45
Sorry, you're trying to find it…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:44:48
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:00
Okay, so… Chapter 4 is a little bit lengthy, I will say.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:07
Um, we're still gonna finish…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:10
earlier, but it's… it's gonna be a little bit of a longer chapter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:15
Um, can everyone see the PowerPoint now?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:19
Can I get a thumbs up? Can you guys see it?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:21
Yeah, awesome. Thanks, guys.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:24
Okay, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:27
Cool

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:29
Okay. Make sure everybody's muted, so that way…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:34
I don't have an echo when I speak. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:37
Okay, so Chapter 4, let's do it. So we're gonna go inside the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:41
So, again, this homework assignment will be due by, um, the night before

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:48
the next class, but it won't be our next class. It'll be the first exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:54
Um, actually, before we do this, let me show you where that is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:45:59
That way, we're not confused. So, coming back to our Canvas course, so next week…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:05
you're going to go to Quizzes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:08
You're not gonna come to class, there's no Zoom, you're not gonna come to Zoom.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:12
you're gonna have a 6-hour window, I think I put it from, like, 5 p.m. to 11pm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:19
Um, you have a 6-hour window to access

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:21
the exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:24
Um, and basically you're gonna click this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:27
Um, and then it's gonna be ready. So, what you want to do is download Lockdown Browser,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:36
Sorry, I'm gonna sneeze.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:39
Excuse me. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:41
So make sure that you guys have Lockdown Browser, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:46
downloaded. Uh, I also want to mention this practice quiz. Do this practice quiz first,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:46:52
It's gonna help you make sure that Lockdown Browser's working before you access Exam 1, okay? This is part of your participation points. I can see everyone who

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:02
completed this practice quiz and who didn't.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:04
Um, it's not graded in the sense of, like, there's not…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:07
you know, hard questions or anything like that. It's one question, but I just want you to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:12
open lockdown browser, make sure it's all downloaded and good to go, open it, and then come to here on Canvas,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:19
Go to the practice quiz, take the quiz, it'll open up,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:22
And it'll go through all of the steps to check and make sure that your exam is, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:28
good to go, so it'll… you'll do an environment check, you'll do a face check,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:32
Um, yeah, make sure that your face is in frame and it's well lit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:37
Um, and yeah, so you want to do that, and then when that's all good to go,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:41
You want to do this way before the exam. Like, try to do this practice quiz this week, okay? Do this practice quiz this week to make sure everything's working.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:50
Because if you try to do it the day of the exam next week,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:55
then… and you have an issue,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:47:57
it's gonna be, you know, kind of tough. Uh, you're responsible for making sure Lockdown Browser works for you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:04
And you have to do this practice quiz earlier, so that way you can fix any issues there are, and you can email me. If you email me the night of the exam,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:13
Saying lockdown browser's not working.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:15
you know, I'm gonna try to help you, but at the end of the day, it's your responsibility, so if you can't take the exam, that's kind of on you, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:22
Lillian, I saw your hand first. What's up?

[Lilian Valencia] 17:48:26
You answered my question. When you say, do it this weekend, I was gonna ask you if we can do it before.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:48:30
Okay, you answered my question.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:30
Yes, it's open… it's open right now, and it's open all semester, in case you get a new… like, I'll click it.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:48:33
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:37
In case you get a new computer,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:40
Um, use this, so you must take this quiz before the first exam to… it'll count towards your attendance and participation grade.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:46
Use this quiz as a trial run to ensure your webcam, microphone, and internet settings are working well before you take the exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:53
This will be, um… this process… sorry, this practice exam…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:48:58
We'll be open all semester in case you get a new computer, you get new Wi-Fi, whatever it is, and you want to test it out to make sure that Lockdown Browser is working, okay? You have unlimited attempts to do this, so make sure that you definitely do it before the first exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:12
And you can, you know, do it all throughout the semester if you need to. You send me, yes.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:49:17
Yeah, Professor, do you say the… the… this practice only has one question, no?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:24
Right, it's just one question. If you look at it, I'll, like, I'll open it.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:49:25
Oh.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:30
Um, look, it requires Lockdown Browser, and I don't have that on my computer, so once you have that,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:35
Um, on…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:37
And, um, you can enter this, and it's just one question. It's like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:42
you know, I don't know what it asks. It's one dumb question, and it doesn't matter. It's not graded. It's just, I need it for completion that you finished it, okay?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:49:50
Okay, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:51
So it's super short, no problem.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:49:53
Okay, is everyone good on that? So, don't come to class next week, you have the exam, but remember, you need to download Lockdown Browser.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:00
And make sure you're using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:05
Um, it likes that the best. I don't know why.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:08
Okay? So, let me know if you have any questions with that, and we'll go ahead and get started.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:16
Can you guys see the PowerPoint?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:18
Yeah. Cool.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:50:21
Yes, progress

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:22
Perfect. Okay, so let's do it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:25
Remember chapter, um, the first exam is gonna cover Chapter 1, 3, and 4.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:30
So, Chapter 1 that we covered on the first day, Chapter 3, the recorded lecture, and then tonight, Chapter 4. Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:38
Okay, so let's look at cells under the microscope. So, cells are the fundamental unit of life. They, um, make up all life, so there's… they're very small,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:50
And they have very diverse functions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:53
all life is made up of cells, like I just said.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:50:56
Um, they're very diverse, there's lots of different types of cells, okay? So if you look over here on the right,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:02
There's muscle cells, there's fat cells, bone, blood, nervous system, immune cells, sex cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:09
There's so many different types of cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:12
And this is just looking at humans. If you go to plants, you have different plant cells and things like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:17
Um, most cells are super small, and they can only be seen with a microscope.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:22
Okay? Nothing too crazy here, just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:27
In general, we're talking about cells, and we're gonna look into cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:31
So there is a limit to cell size.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:34
Cells need to rapidly exchange materials with the external environment, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:40
So, cells need to be able to communicate with other cells, they need to be able to

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:46
Um, communicate information, they need to pass nutrients and materials.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:51
And they need to be able to do that quickly and efficiently, because if your body or a living thing,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:51:57
need something, it needs it, you know, quickly, so it has to be able to be very efficient.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:02
And how these cells do this, even though they're so small,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:06
is that they have a large surface area.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:09
So, surface area is basically…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:11
If we look at this cube right here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:14
If you add up all of the areas of each of the surfaces, right? Here's the surface, this front.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:21
um, square, looking at this cube here, and then you have this one here on the top, you have this one on the side, you have the bottom, you have them all around, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:30
So if you add up all of those, um, surfaces,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:34
You'll get the surface area.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:36
So, cells, um, are very small, but that helps them with their surface area to volume ratio.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:43
So, the… please write this down. The higher the ratio of surface area to internal volume,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:52
The faster the exchange of materials with the environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:52:55
So the higher the ratio of surface area to internal volume.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:00
Meaning, it has a high surface area and a smaller internal volume.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:06
So, right, cells are small, but they have high…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:10
surface area, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:12
You can kind of see that here with these cubes. So here you have a 1…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:17
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:26
Um, you have one large cube.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:30
And, uh, it's a 4cm cube, so it's pretty large. But if you break that cube into a bunch of different smaller cubes, in this case it's 8 cubes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:40
you're gonna have more surface area, because

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:43
With this big cube, you're just getting the surface of this front square, the side square, the back square, all the squares, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:53:51
But when you break up the cube into smaller cubes, you don't just get this front area, you get all of the sides on the inside and underneath,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:01
And you get all of that extra surface area, so there's more surface area. So imagine if you broke it up into even more, the surface area would be

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:09
even bigger, even though the volume is small.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:12
Okay, so the more surface area, the more space there is,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:17
to exchange materials and nutrients in and out of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:22
Okay? So that's the key for this slide. The higher the ratio of surface area to internal volume,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:29
the faster the exchange of materials.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:54:32
with the environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:03
Okay. So now we're gonna go into the plasma membrane. So, hopefully you guys watched my video from Chapter 3.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:10
Um, the plasma membrane is a membrane that is surrounding the cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:16
Okay? And, um, it's made up of phospholipids and a phospholipid bilayer, which

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:25
I'll talk about more in a second. But anyway, all cells have an outer membrane called this plasma membrane.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:55:32
Thanks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:33
Yeah?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:37
Hello? Any questions?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 17:55:39
No, no, I'm sorry, Professor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:41
That's okay. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:44
So this plasma membrane acts like a boundary layer

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:48
Um, protecting things from coming…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:51
Um, coming in and going out of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:55
Okay? And it can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:55:57
bring nutrients in, it can bring materials in, it can do the same thing outwards.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:02
So just like we talked about with the surface area,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:05
You want a large surface area with these cells, because that is how

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:10
Um, these cells are able to transport things in and out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:13
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:16
And, um, the structure of the plasma membrane, it's called a fluid mosaic model.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:23
Um… that might be on your homework, but I don't know about your exam. Just, it's a fluid mosaic model.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:28
Mosaic means, like, pattern, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:31
Um, and it's fluid. That's an important point.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:34
So, this whole, um, membrane is fluid in that things can kind of… think of it like… think of it like a crowd. Like, think of all these red heads over here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:45
These are all people, right? And you're going through a crowd of people. And you push your way through a crowd. You can move

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:51
you know, relatively. You can move through that crowd of people, right? It's fluid. You can move things

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:57
through it and in and out of it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:59
So, it's not a very, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:04
I guess, sturdy or durable membrane, but it is a protective membrane, but it still is fluid to allow things to go in and out of it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:12
Okay? So, they call it a mosaic model because it has a bunch of different components.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:19
First off, you can see the phospholipid bilayer right here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:22
Which are the redheads and the yellow tails, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:27
These are types of lipids that we talked about in Chapter 3.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:31
And the, um, red heads are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:35
um, hydrophilic, which means they love water.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:40
And the yellow tails are fatty acids, which means they're lipids, and they don't like water, so they're hydrophobic.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:46
Okay? So there's two layers of these. They have the first layer here, and the second layer here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:53
looking, in general, the inside of the cell and the outside of the cell have water, okay? So, these red heads are gonna face towards that water. They're attracted to the water that's on the inside of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:04
And they're attracted to the water that's on the outside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:09
Or I guess, inside-outside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:11
Um, anyway, and then the tails are gonna stick inward, because they're scaredy cats, and they don't like water, so they're gonna hang out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:18
on the inside. Yes, Lillian?

[Lilian Valencia] 17:58:21
So, those…

[Lilian Valencia] 17:58:24
the head on the top and the head on the bottom, that's where they collect the water.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:58:28
So it's gonna be on both, it's gonna have, uh, water.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:58:32
The fluid?

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:32
it's not collecting water, it's just attracted to the water that's in this environment, on the inside and the outside.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:58:40
Okay. Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:41
So, it's just a… it's just a property that it… it likes water, so it's gonna be attracted to water, kind of like a magnet.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:48
Okay, but it doesn't collect it, it doesn't hold water, it's just attracted to it.

[Lilian Valencia] 17:58:49
So, tap…

[Lilian Valencia] 17:58:51
So it would be on the top and bottom that will attract the… okay, all right.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:54
Mm-hmm. Exactly. The top and the bottom.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:57
And they call it a mosaic pattern because

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:01
this whole thing is the plasma membrane, but think of this, you know, covering an entire cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:06
But it has parts in it. It has the phospholipid bilayer that I just explained.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:12
It has these proteins, um, a bunch of different types of proteins, and they have other things like cholesterol and, you know, other hormones and different things, which we won't get super into, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:25
Anyway, it's, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:27
it's a complex model.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:29
Okay? But just know that the fossil lipid bilayer is a component of the plasma membrane. Definitely write that down.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:38
The phospholipid bilayer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:41
is a component

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:43
of the plasma membrane. I think I wrote that in the next slide. Yeah, I did. I literally wrote it right here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:50
So this is it on a little bit of a bigger scale.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:55
And here are these, um, phospholipids, which I told you about. So the head,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:59
is, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:02
Hydrophilic, which means it loves the water, and the tails are hydrophobic, which means they are, um, afraid of water. So, these guys…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:11
make up this, uh, double layer, this bilayer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:16
And this is what makes up the membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:20
One of the components of the membrane of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:24
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:29
Does this make sense to everybody?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:32
Lillian, make sure that you go and watch the Chapter 3 lecture, because I explained the whole hydrophobic, hydrophilic thing more, okay? So that should help answer any questions that you have about that.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:00:42
I sure will, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:43
For sure. Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:46
So that's the plasma membrane, and it's, again, surrounding this cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:50
Okay? This is, uh, an animal cell, for example.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:56
And we're gonna go in and talk about all of these organelles that are in here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:00
But first, we want to talk about the membrane proteins, okay? So these purple things, these proteins here, these purple proteins,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:09
They all, um, there's a bunch of different types, and they have different functions, so we're gonna go through 6 of them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:16
Okay? So, don't worry if you didn't get the full list, we're gonna go through each one. What I would do is write the name of the protein, you can write this little description about it, and you can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:27
do a little drawing, if you want.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:30
In your notes. So, to orient yourselves, this… what is this layer right here?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:37
What do you guys think? We just talked about it.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:01:43
Those are not the little mold cycles that you say?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:48
These are the phospholipids, yeah, but the whole thing is, um, the plasma membrane. So we're looking at it like we cut it

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:01:53
Ms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:56
in half, and we're looking at it, uh, like a cross-section. So we're looking at it on the side.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:01
So here are these phospholipids, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:04
But it has this protein here, so this is the plasma membrane. So we're just looking at it on the side.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:10
So this is outside of the cell, in the blue, and then the tan is inside of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:15
So, first off, we're going to look at channel proteins. So, this is an example of a channel protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:21
Sorry, I'm gonna cough really quick.

[Juan Santos] 18:02:29
Professor Guatemal, your… your colleague?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:34
Sorry, my what?

[Juan Santos] 18:02:37
COVID.

[Juan Santos] 18:02:39
I mean, the virus, the COVID.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:41
Oh, COVID! Yeah.

[Juan Santos] 18:02:42
Holy. Yeah, yeah, I think it's better, or…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:43
Yeah, yeah, much better. We talked about it in the beginning of class. I'm much better. Thank you so much.

[Juan Santos] 18:02:49
I'll be a game that victor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:49
That's okay. Thank you so much.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:52
I still have a little bit of congestion and some cough, you know, left over, but that's gonna be going on for a long time, probably, so…

[Juan Santos] 18:02:53
So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:00
But thank you so much.

[Juan Santos] 18:03:00
So, those, uh, literate…

[Juan Santos] 18:03:03
Those little things, they love you.

[Juan Santos] 18:03:06
Because you had studied then, you know, they say they…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:11
I know, right?

[Juan Santos] 18:03:12
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:13
They're attracted. It's funny.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:14
Oh, man. Um, okay, so…

[Juan Santos] 18:03:17
professor, in that… in that membrane,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:19
Yes.

[Juan Santos] 18:03:20
either the receptors, receptors from… for…

[Juan Santos] 18:03:25
to… yeah, that's… for the virus to enter the cell, there is

[Juan Santos] 18:03:31
receivers, receptors,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:32
receptors, yeah. So…

[Juan Santos] 18:03:33
That member, yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:34
Mm-hmm. It…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:37
Viruses and diseases are, um, they're a little bit different, but in general, yes, there are certain receptors that are

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:44
on the tops of cells, um, that try to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:48
fight against, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:50
any viruses or any bacteria, but sometimes the viruses get into the cell, and that's, you know, why people get sick, but that's a whole different process, but yes, it's similar. There are receptors on our cells that

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:04
Um, help protect from viruses, but also can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:08
can bring them in, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:11
That's a different thing, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:13
With this example, with the channel proteins, um, this forms a tunnel across a membrane, and it allows the passage for only a few specific molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:23
So here, you guys can see this little indentation in the middle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:27
It's a, uh, it's a tunnel, right? So you can think tunnel, or like a channel,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:33
This is a protein, um, that has a channel or a tunnel in it, so it's a channel protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:38
And this allows only a few specific molecules, so it's only this little…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:43
you know, for example, this little green molecule that can go in and out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:48
So they're very specific.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:50
These proteins are very specific for certain types of molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:55
Okay? Next, we have transport proteins, which often combine with the substance to help transport it through the membrane. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:04
This is the protein, this purple thing right here. It kind of looks like a baseball glove, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:10
So, this baseball glove, you can pretend it, um, captured this little green…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:16
molecule?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:18
And it combined with the green molecule. So think about a baseball glove,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:23
closing in and catching a baseball, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:26
So that's kind of what this protein does. It, um, combines with the substance to help transport the substance through the membrane and, you know, into or out of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:38
So it's just a little bit of a different mechanism. The channel proteins, they can… the molecules can just slide right through in and out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:46
But it only allows certain molecules to go through.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:49
the channel proteins. The transport proteins, um, can bind… can combine with other substances and help it come through the membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:07
Next, we have cell recognition proteins. So, these help our bodies distinguish between our cells and those of other organisms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:16
Um, one second, Brandon. And these proteins can help to

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:20
um, help the cell to recognize, right, recognition. It helps the cell to recognize

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:26
other, um, cells that are within our own bodies, or if they are foreign bodies. For example, like the viruses or whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:34
Um, again, those are more complex.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:38
ideas, or more complex systems, but in general, it helps us, um, these proteins help

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:44
ourselves to recognize ourselves versus other, um, other cells. Yes, Brandon?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:06:50
I'm sorry, Professor, um, could you please just go back to the last slide really fast, so I can just copy down the…

[Brandon Montejo] 18:06:57
Transport.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:57
For sure. I will… no, I can… I can go back, no problem. But just a reminder, I'm gonna be going a little bit quicker today. Sorry, I have to move a little quicker, just because we have a lot to go through.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:07
But you do have all of these slides, so if you need to go back,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:11
Just put a little star and say, okay, I need to go back on the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:14
The lecture slides and, you know, finish writing whatever it was, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:18
Don't freak out if, you know, if I'm going a little fast. You will have… you do have access to all of these slides, so you won't miss any of the information.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:07:24
Okay.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:07:27
Got it, thank you so much.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:28
For sure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:31
Okay, so that's cell recognition proteins, now receptor proteins, so these have a specific shape for a specific

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:39
molecule called a signal molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:42
So this molecule can bind to this protein, and it changes the shape of the protein, and it triggers a cellular response.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:51
Okay? Uh, sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:53
So, this lighter purple

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:57
uh, thing is called a signal molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:01
It's very specific, and you see how it fits like a puzzle piece?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:04
into this type of protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:06
Okay? So only this signal molecule can bind with this…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:13
Um, with this type of receptor protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:16
So once it binds with it, then the shape of the protein and the shape of the molecule

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:23
can change a little bit, and with that change, it's gonna trigger some type of cellular response. So it's gonna tell it to do… it's gonna tell the cell to do something, to make something, or to send something somewhere.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:34
whatever it might be. I know this is a little vague,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:39
Um, but that's kind of the point, is I'm just explaining the general kind of mechanisms of these.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:45
Not necessarily the specific examples, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:57
And then we have two left.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:01
We have enzymatic proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:04
way to directly participate in metabolic reactions, so kind of similar to

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:09
Um, the receptor proteins that we just looked at before, these enzymatic proteins,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:15
Um, have certain molecules that bind to it as well. Again, in a specific type of shape.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:21
And once that molecule binds to the protein, it can go through some type of metabolic reaction, or like a chemical reaction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:30
And it will produce, uh, something else. So the end product is gonna look different than that first molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:38
That came in. And we're going to talk a lot more about this in Chapter 4.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:43
5. Yeah, which is next.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:47
And then lastly, we have junction proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:50
So, junction proteins assist with, um, cell-to-cell adhesion and also communication.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:57
So you can see, these are two different cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:01
Um, or it could be one cell that is kind of, like, smushed.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:05
And you have these junction proteins that allow for communication between

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:10
um, these two cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:12
So, if these two proteins from the two cells are touching, then they can communicate with each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:18
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:20
Whether that be through chemical,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:22
signaling or any type of molecule that goes through, or whatever it might be, but we'll talk more about junction proteins a little bit later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:38
Okay, so make sure that you know these 6. I would try to draw them in your notes, um, you know, pen to paper, like I mentioned, is really important.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:46
To help you remember this, but also drawing out things if you are a visual learner. That can definitely help you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:53
Because you'll think on the exam, oh yeah, I know what, um, a junction protein is. I remember drawing it with the two proteins connected to each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:01
you know, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:03
So I definitely recommend you do that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:07
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:09
So we have, uh, two main types of cells. We're at 4.3 now. We have, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:15
eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, which I'll talk about in just a second.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:19
But all cells have certain characteristics in common. So for this slide, please write it down, but only… you only have to write the bolded letters, the bolded words, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:29
So what are the three characteristics common to all types of cells?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:34
Number one is that all cells have a plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:37
Okay, so number one, write plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:43
This plasma membrane has a phospholipid bilayer, and it helps regulate materials inside

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:49
and out of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:52
Second, all cells have a cytoplasm, which is a semi-fluid interior where chemical reactions occur.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:00
So basically, if you look inside of a cell,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:04
There are all these little organelles, like the mitochondria, the nucleus, we'll talk about those in just a little bit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:09
all of the organelles floating around in this, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:14
kind of jelly-like soup called the cytoplasm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:18
Okay? It's like soup.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:21
You can think of the liquid in soup, and that's what a cytoplasm is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:24
And all of the veggies, and the chicken, and whatever else is in your soup.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:28
Those are the organelles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:31
that are swimming around.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:33
And then lastly, is DNA. So all cells have DNA. It's the genetic material that provides information for activities, growth, reproduction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:44
repair, um, you know, all those other cellular…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:51
cellular things. So the three things, the three characteristics common to all cells, again, this is an easy exam question.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:59
Number one, plasma membrane. Number two, cytoplasm. And number three, DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:05
So all cells have the plasma membrane, they have a cytoplasm within, and then they have the DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:13
Um, inside as well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:18
Okay, so there's two types of cells. There are prokaryotic cells, and there's eukaryotic cells. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:26
kind of know the main differences between these two.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:29
So, prokaryotic cells, this is kind of what they look like in general.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:33
Um, they're more simple, and they have a little, uh, flagella, or a little tail, that helps them move around.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:41
And, um, they lack a membrane-bound nucleus, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:46
The nucleus, if you look over here on the right in this eukaryotic cell, this orange thing,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:52
This is the nucleus, and this is where the DNA lives.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:55
Okay, so the DNA lives inside the nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:58
But in prokaryotic cells,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:01
they don't have a membrane-bound nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:03
So the DNA is just floating around, okay? It's just floating around, not much.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:10
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:12
structure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:13
Uh, DNA is located in the nucleoid, which is basically just means it's floating around, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:18
So, prokaryotic cells were the first to appear on Earth. They're very, very, very old.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:24
And the most common example is bacteria.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:28
Okay? And they're very simple, like I said. So, prokaryotic cells are very simple, they're very old,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:33
And they're not very well organized. They just have their DNA kind of floating around everywhere.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:39
And why? Because they don't have a membrane-bound nucleus. Their nucleus doesn't have a membrane, so it's not enclosed, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:57
So now, looking at eukaryotic cells…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:00
eukaryotic cells are, um, much more advanced. They have a membrane-bound nucleus, okay, so they have that nucleus with the membrane, so all the DNA is inside the nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:11
And they are more complex.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:15
Okay? A lot of the diversity on Earth is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:18
the more diverse and more complex organisms are eukaryotic organisms.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:23
made up of eukaryotic cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:27
Okay? For example, our bodies, humans, we have eukaryotic cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:33
We don't have prokaryotic cells.

[Juan Santos] 18:15:45
Professor, why have a…

[Juan Santos] 18:15:48
they, the probiotic cells,

[Juan Santos] 18:15:52
developed for billions of years.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:56
They're very effective.

[Juan Santos] 18:15:56
Why is this thing, I mean, stay the same for…

[Juan Santos] 18:16:00
so long.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:01
they stayed the same for so long because they just are very effective at what they do. So, um, we're not gonna get into it in this class, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:09
They have, um… they're very effective at multiplying, so they can just divide by themselves. They don't need another organism to reproduce, so they can just split up themselves and

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:20
Multiply. Um, so they're easy reproduction. They can, um, survive in

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:26
many different conditions. They can live in really warm conditions, really hot conditions.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:31
really cold, um, high pressure deep in the ocean, they can survive in water, they can survive on land.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:38
Um, they can survive in a bunch of different extreme places, and also they have, um, this kind of protective outer covering.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:46
it's like an additional outer covering that…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:50
further protects the cell, so they're difficult to…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:54
destroy or get rid of.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:56
So, yeah, they've survived a long time just because they're so effective. They're… they're very…

[Juan Santos] 18:16:57
Well, they are very…

[Juan Santos] 18:17:01
It's still being sold.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:02
Mm-hmm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:04
Yeah, for real.

[Juan Santos] 18:17:05
Bye.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:07
Exactly.

[Patrice Donald] 18:17:07
I have a question. For today's lesson.

[Patrice Donald] 18:17:10
I see we went through 3 top… this is, like, the third one today. Um, we're talking about prokaryotic and eukaryotic… are we getting into, like, plants and humans?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:10
Mm-hmm.

[Patrice Donald] 18:17:21
Because I know one of these only have either… one of them don't contain a cytoplasm,

[Patrice Donald] 18:17:26
I don't remember what it was, but one of these don't have what the other one has.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:31
Exactly. So, we're not going to be talking about plants, we're going to be talking about the eukaryotic cell, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:37
We're going to be talking about these guys on the right, but the main difference is, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:44
the prokaryotic cells don't have a lot of the organelles that eukaryotic cells have.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:49
But the prokaryotic cells don't have the membrane-bound nucleus, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:54
their DNA, like I said, is just kind of everywhere.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:58
They don't have a nucleus, whereas the eukaryotic cells do have a nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:02
Um, there is cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells. It might be called something different, but they do have something similar, but

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:10
We're going to be talking about the eukaryotic cells,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:13
Which, in general, eukaryotic cells covers plants, animals,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:20
Um, fungi, you know, complex things, but we're gonna be looking at the model of an animal cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:27
For simplicity. So hopefully that answers your question.

[Patrice Donald] 18:18:32
Yes, it does.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:33
Awesome. So, let's take a tour of the eukaryotic cell. So, let me preface this by saying we're going to be making a big table in your notes, okay? So everyone be ready, you're gonna draw a big table in your notes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:46
the, um, first…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:49
the first column is gonna say Organelle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:53
And the second column is gonna say function.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:56
Okay? Is everyone with me?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:59
You want to make a big table in your notes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:04
on one side, it's gonna say Organelle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:08
And the other, uh, column is gonna say…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:12
function, and we're gonna have all of these that we're gonna go through.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:16
Okay? Nucleus, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, etc. We're gonna go through all of these, and what I want you to do, basically, for now till the end of the lecture, or at least until we get to, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:28
you know, the end part of this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:30
you're gonna be writing the organelle, and then I'm gonna spell out the function for you. So you're gonna write the organelle name, and then you're gonna write the function.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:37
Okay? And that's what you'll have to remember for the exam. So you're going to make this big ol' table,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:43
And you can write other notes, you know, next to it to make sure you remember it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:48
But in general, you're just gonna know the name of the

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:52
Oregonel, and the function.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:54
So, first up, we have the nucleus, and the function is to store genetic information.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:01
Okay? I'm gonna tell you a bunch of other stuff about each of these guys, but in general, like I said, just know the name and the function.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:10
So, the nucleus is kind of like the brain of the cell, it's holding all of the genetic information, uh, it has the DNA, it's gonna have the RNA, etc. This is what it looks like.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:21
And if you see this…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:23
kind of, uh, double membrane here. This is the membrane around the nucleus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:28
that eukaryotic cells have, that prokaryotic cells do not have.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:33
Okay? So, within the DNA, there's chromatin, which we'll talk more about that later on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:39
Um, and then there's something called a nuclear envelope, which is this, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:45
membrane that I just told you about. So this double membrane is called the nuclear envelope.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:51
That's, you know…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:53
a good thing to know, in general. But, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:57
yeah, I would write that down.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:59
Nuclear envelope. Um, it's the membrane around the nucleus, because like I said, for prokaryotes, they don't have that, but eukaryotic cells, they do have that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:09
Okay? And again, this is an example of an animal cell, which is the eukaryotic cell, and we are looking inside of this cell in all of the

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:20
Um, organelles, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:24
An organelle is kind of like, you can think of them like our organs, right? We have kidneys, we have lung, we have heart, we have…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:32
stomach, we have all of these things, and they each do… they have different functions, right? Same thing in the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:37
There's different organ nails, like organ…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:41
nails, small organs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:42
Inside the cell, and they all have different functions. So we're gonna go through those.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:47
So that's the nucleus. Next, we have these ribosomes, and these ribosomes are these little red

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:53
things that have two kind of units next to them. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:57
The function is to use information from the nucleus to manufacture proteins for cellular and metabolic activities.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:04
That's a long way to say…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:06
manufacture proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:08
or make proteins. That's all you have to write.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:12
make proteins, okay? So ribosomes are responsible for making proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:18
There is a large subunit and a small subunit

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:23
Uh, that make up the ribosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:25
And basically…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:27
Some of them are free, just roaming around in the cytoplasm, right? They're in that soup, they're just hanging around the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:34
And some of them are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:38
Which we'll talk about in just a little bit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:42
But the function of ribosomes is to make protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:47
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:52
They look like these little red guys. You can draw a little picture next to it if you'd like.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:57
To help you remember.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:10
Okay, so that's the ribosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:14
Now we'll go to the endoplasmic reticulum.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:17
Which is the ER. It's an interconnected system of channels, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:23
Here is where the nucleus was, if you guys can see my cursor right here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:27
This is where the nuclear envelope is, so that's where the nucleus is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:31
And now we're looking at this big, kind of, maze-like thing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:36
So, we have two different, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:39
types of endoplasmic reticulum, or ER.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:43
The first is rough ER. So these should be two separate

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:48
lines, or two separate rows in your table, okay? Rough ER and smooth ER.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:54
So the rough ER is studded with ribosomes, so this is the rough ER over here on the right.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:00
You can see the red ribosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:03
studded all over on this, um, system.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:06
So, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:09
they call it rough ER because the ribosomes, they kind of look like if you were to touch it, it would be kind of a rough surface, right? It'd be kind of bumpy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:18
And the function of this is to synthesize polypeptides.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:23
Also known as making protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:27
Okay? Which that should be easy to remember, because we already know that ribosomes make protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:33
So, rough ER…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:36
rough endoplasmic reticulum.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:37
is rough, because it has ribosomes on it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:41
So, that means it also makes proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:44
Synthesize is another word for making or creating.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:48
polypeptides, if you guys watched my Chapter 3 lecture.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:52
Um, basically just means proteins as well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:55
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:59
So, rough ER.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:05
Next to the rough ER, connected to it is something called the smooth ER.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:09
So this is the smooth ER over here. It doesn't have any ribosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:14
on it, so if you were to run your hand over it, it would be smooth.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:18
So, that's the easiest way to remember it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:21
Rough ER is studded with those ribosomes to make it rough if you were to touch it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:25
Smooth ER is nice and smooth.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:27
And the function of the smooth ER is to synthesize lipids, or to make or create lipids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:35
Okay? And you can think about it. Lipids are like oil and fat, right? And they're kind of smooth, they're kind of greasy, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:43
the smooth ER makes those lipids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:07
Okay, so rough ER, make protein or synthesize quality peptide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:12
smooth ER to synthesize lipids, or to make lipids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:18
Next, we have the Golgi apparatus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:21
We'll talk about the lysosomes in just a little bit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:23
But the Golgi apparatus, this scientist named Golgi, he founded it, so of course he named it after himself.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:31
Um, these are a stack of slightly curved and flattened structures. That's this blue, kind of,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:40
um, structure down here in this picture.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:42
And you can think of it like a transfer station, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:46
What's the function? It sorts, modifies, and repackages molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:53
Okay? That can be what you can write down for the function, just the first part of this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:58
It sorts, modifies,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:59
and repackages molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:03
into new transport vesicles for their destination.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:07
So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:11
Yeah. So, you want to think of the Golgi apparatus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:15
You can think of this A in apparatus, think of Amazon.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:19
Okay? Like an Amazon warehouse.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:23
So, Golgi apparatus is like Amazon. At an Amazon warehouse, it's a transfer station, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:30
It's gonna sort all your packages, it's gonna modify anything if there's anything that's broken, or…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:37
Um, messed up, it's gonna fix it, and then it's gonna repackage it, and it's gonna ship it out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:42
Right? Or it's gonna send it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:45
Um, in transport vesicles, like a vehicle, like a truck, you know, like an Amazon truck, or a…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:51
you know, delivery truck, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:54
So, you can think of the Golgi apparatus as an Amazon warehouse.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:02
It sorts, modifies, and repackages molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:06
The lysosomes are vesicles that are produced by the Golgi apparatus. I put these guys together because

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:13
They work together, so those delivery trucks

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:16
That I mentioned. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:21
Well, those are going to be, I guess, other vesicles, but the lysosomes are… you can think of them like the garbage trucks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:28
Okay, so they are attached to the Amazon warehouse, and they take up all the trash. They pick up all the garbage.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:35
They digest molecules, so they take in all of the

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:39
damaged goods, they break down any damaged organelles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:43
And they do that with enzymes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:46
So, lysosomes, I want you to think of the garbage truck.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:49
Okay? It'll go to the Amazon warehouse, and it'll take up all the trash. It'll smush it down, all the garbage,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:57
it'll, you know, take it away.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:00
So, the function of lysosomes is to digest molecules,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:04
And to break down damaged organelles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:20
And that works very closely with the Golgi apparatus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:37
Okay? That's the Golgi, and that's the lysosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:41
How are we doing so far? Everybody doing good? Can I get a thumbs up?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:46
Is this making sense to everybody. You guys got your table that you're drawing?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:50
Awesome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:04
Okay, so now we have vesicles and vacuoles. So, these two guys are pretty similar, but they have a little bit of a difference.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:14
So both of these are membranous sacs, so basically they're like little…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:20
containers, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:21
And they enclose molecules, so they hold molecules,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:26
And they keep them separate from the cytoplasm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:28
So there look like little bubbles, basically. You see these little bubbles here?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:33
These are vesicles and vacuoles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:37
And you can think vesicle, it kind of sounds like the word vehicle, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:42
It's like a transport…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:44
Um… and storage.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:48
function. So, that's their function. Vesicles and vacuoles are for storage, and they're for transport.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:56
So, they take molecules and they transport them to other places in the cell,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:01
And they store them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:04
for, you know, short-term or long-term.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:08
One thing I want you to know that will be on your exam, and I know it's a homework question too, the difference between vacuoles and vesicles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:17
vacuoles are larger and they're more specialized compared to vesicles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:25
So, vacuoles, you can think of, they're like a big truck.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:29
In a vesicle, you can think of it like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:31
a car. Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:33
So, vesicles are like cars, vacuoles are like a big truck.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:38
So, some vacuole, some do some digestion.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:42
Some move water. Water can be kind of a big molecule.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:45
So, it just depends. They can be specialized, and they're usually larger.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:52
Okay? But all the same, their function…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:57
for both of them, is storage and transport.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:30
Vesicles and vacuoles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:33
Okay, so now we're just gonna look at what we've looked at so far. So up here…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:39
This is a great, uh, image to help you guys study, to remember everything, and to see a visual.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:44
So up here on the top of the image, if you can see my cursor,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:48
That is the nucleus, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:51
And then if you come over here, it's attached in this little channel.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:55
to the rough ER, okay? And what does the rough ER do? It makes proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:01
Okay? Actually, I'll have you guys tell me what it does. So that's the rough ER. The rough ER is then connected to this. Someone tell me what this is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:12
the smooth ER, yeah. So, someone else, tell me, what's the function of the smooth ER?

[ALIYAH GORDON] 18:33:21
It creates slippage?

[Carolina Leyton] 18:33:22
Crazy

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:23
It creates lipids. Awesome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:25
So, now we're next to it. We have these little transport vesicles. So what do vesicles do? What's the function of vesicles?

[Clery Altamirano] 18:33:33
Transport.

[Vaughn Clarke] 18:33:35
storage.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:35
Yep. Transport and storage, awesome.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:33:35
transport, dark.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:39
So, now we're gonna go down here to the Golgi apparatus. So what does the Golgi apparatus do?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:33:47
That's the sorts and modify.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:49
Exactly.

[Clery Altamirano] 18:33:50
Every package.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:52
every packages, it sorts, it modifies, awesome. So, when you think of the Golgi apparatus, what do you want to think of? What kind of warehouse?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:34:01
Amazon.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:02
like an Amazon warehouse, exactly.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:07
Some mosquito in my room, sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:09
Um, okay. And… lysosomes, that's the other thing. So what do lysosomes do?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:34:17
It digest molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:19
the molecules, yes, they digest molecules. You're good, no worries.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:34:21
molecules.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:23
they digest the molecules, and they break down any old or damaged cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:29
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:32
All right, so that's a little review of what we've done so far. We have a few more to go.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:36
Um, so let's keep going. We have the energy-related organelles. So, we're gonna talk a lot about both of these, the chloroplast and the mitochondria.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:46
In chapters 6 and 7?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:49
But, um, chloroplasts…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:51
These guys are found in cells, or excuse me, in plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:56
plants and algae, but their function is to use solar energy to synthesize carbohydrates.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:03
And they do this with, uh, photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:07
So make sure you write down this whole function.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:10
So that way you guys know, and you remember that it's with Photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:15
And it's with plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:21
Okay, so the function of the chloroplast…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:24
is to use solar energy so that it uses

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:27
Energy from the sun.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:29
to synthesize carbohydrates, or, you know, creates or makes carbohydrates,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:35
And it does that with photosynthesis.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:48
So that happens in plants and algae.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:52
And then, in animals, we have… also, I guess, mitochondria also happens in plants, but less so. Chloroplasts

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:01
are the main characters in…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:03
plants, but mitochondria more so happens in animals.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:07
Um, they do kind of the opposite. So, chloroplasts synthesize carbohydrates,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:13
mitochondria break down carbohydrates, okay? So they're doing the opposite. They break down carbohydrates,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:20
to produce ATP.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:23
via cellular respiration.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:25
Don't worry about the, um, adenosine triphosphate, that's just what ATP stands for.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:31
Um, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:33
what I want you to know is their function, they break down carbohydrates to produce ATP. ATP is an energy molecule we're gonna learn about later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:42
And it does this via cellular respiration.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:46
I know these kind of seem weird, like, with lots of weird words that we haven't talked about yet, but we're gonna talk more about these in, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:55
Chapter 6 and 7, but these go together because photosynthesis

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:59
And cellular respiration are kind of opposite processes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:03
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:33
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:49
So, it's also called the powerhouse of the cell, which you'll hear a lot about later.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:55
So now we have the cytoskeleton.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:58
So, it's a network of interconnected protein filaments and tubules that extend from the nucleus

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:04
to the plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:06
Basically, um, they are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:09
kind of like they sound. Cytoskeleton. So, cyto means…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:15
of the cell, and skeleton, we know what a skeleton is, right? So it's the skeleton of a cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:21
So it's basically the, um, backbone and the support for movement of the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:28
Okay, so that's their function. Movement and support.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:31
They help the cell move, and they help support it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:34
by giving it structure. So, think about it, it has, like, protein,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:39
Um, filaments, it has these fibers, kind of like a spiderweb.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:43
that help protect it and give it, uh, strength and structure.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:50
Microtubules are a part of the cytoskeleton, that's, um, these green…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:55
lines over here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:58
And they help maintain the size of the… the shape of the cell, um, and they're involved with, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:05
cellular reproduction later. They're involved with the cell dividing.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:10
But we'll talk about that later. But anyway, cytoskeleton…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:15
Sorry. The function is movement and support.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:21
Okay, it's like a network of fibers to support the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:01
Okay, cytoskeleton.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:03
Now we'll do the last ones, which are cilia and flagella.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:08
So, cilia are these little guys right here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:12
They're shorter, and they are a little more stiff.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:16
Um, they kind of move side to side. They're… they're kind of little projections.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:22
Flagella, on the other hand, are these long tails that were, um, if you remember in the prokaryotic cells,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:29
they had a flagella, like a long tail, to help them with movement.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:33
So, flagella help, um, or they move in an undulating way, which undulating means, like, side to side like this, like a snake.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:43
Uh, the cilia just move side to side, like, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:49
I don't know how to describe… just side-to-side, like, up and down.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:52
the flagella move like a snake in more of an undulating…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:57
way, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:00
Um, and obviously they are much longer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:02
So, the function of these guys is movement.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:06
So, depending on the cell, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:10
type. Some cells might have flagella, for example, sperm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:14
Sperm have a long flagella.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:16
And some cells might have cilia.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:19
Um, depending on the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:22
Um, the nature. So, cilia could also be for absorption of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:31
oxygen and blood, like in the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:33
like, these cilia are found in our lungs, so they help us to breathe better.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:38
But in general, they are for movement.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:41
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:46
I guess we should update that and rate for absorption as well, but that's okay, just movement.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:04
Okay, so now we're done with the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:09
eukaryotic cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:11
Um, on the inside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:13
Okay, so really quick, for fun, everyone show me your tables. Just hold them up. If you took notes, let me see your tables.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:22
If you did it on your computer, it's okay, but awesome. I love these paper notes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:29
Amazing. Great, Nicholas. Good job, Sadie.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:32
Thank you, everyone. Great job.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:42:33
I guess my screen is blurry in the back that you cannot really see it, so I guess I have to put it in my face? I don't know, so you can see it?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:38
Yeah, there you go. I see it, Lillian, you're good.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:42
Thank you, Liam. Thank you, Simi. Great job, guys. You're me, I see you. Perfect.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:47
Awesome. Love paper notes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:50
I love that you guys are taking my advice and writing down your notes. Um, great job.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:55
Okay, so now the last little bit of class, we're going to look outside the eukaryotic cell, just looking at, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:04
different parts of different cells, and also junctions and things like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:09
So the last thing that I wanted to mention, um, I guess you can add this to your table as well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:14
This isn't for eukaryotic cells, though. This is for plant cells, or sorry, this is eukaryotic cells, but this is specifically for plant cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:23
Okay? So, these are cell walls.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:27
And their function is to provide support for the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:31
So these are found in plants, in fungi, and in produce, but they're not found in animals. So, it is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:37
kind of an exception or a, um, a special case of eukaryotic cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:43
But they're not found in all…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:45
eukaryotic cells, like, they're not found in animals. So that's why

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:49
I said we're going, you know, separate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:51
But anyway, this green, if you look at the, um, image here, this

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:56
thick green part.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:59
This is the cell wall of plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:02
Okay? So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:05
plant cells…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:08
are a little more sturdy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:10
And they're a little bit harder to digest.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:13
Compared to animal cells, because they have this cell wall, and the cell wall is made of cellulose, which I mentioned in Chapter 3. That's a type of carbohydrate.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:23
Okay, it's a complex carb.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:26
So it helps to give it structure and support.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:32
So that's the function of the cell wall. I'm pretty sure that's the last one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:36
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:39
Yeah, but anyway.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:41
Okay, so last thing, we'll talk about junctions. So, remember way back in the beginning of class when I talked about junction proteins?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:49
The two purple proteins that were, like, touching each other, so they could communicate with other cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:56
You guys remember that? But now we're going to talk about 3 different types of those junction proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:03
Uh, number one, we have adhesion junctions, so that's looking at this top right image here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:10
So this is when adjacent plasma membranes don't touch, they do not touch,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:15
But they're held together by filaments attached to button-like thickenings.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:20
So this button-like thickening is this purple… hopefully you guys can see my cursor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:25
is this purple…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:27
protein here, and it's just, like, a thick button, okay? It's a weird way to describe it, but it kind of makes sense.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:34
it's a button, and it's kind of thick, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:37
So, but that's a protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:39
So this protein has filaments that… you see these purple filaments?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:45
that go in between.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:47
the other cell and the other, uh, protein.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:51
that is how these guys are, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:55
you know, this… that is this type of junction. It's an adhesion junction. It sticks together with those

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:02
of filaments.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:04
Okay? And again,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:06
all of these junctions can be for communication between cells, they can be for passing

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:11
nutrients, it just depends.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:15
Next, the other type is a tight junction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:19
So this is kind of like the, um, junction protein… the slide before that I mentioned with the two purple…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:27
Um, proteins…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:29
kind of on top of each other, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:31
You can kind of look and see that's kind of what these look like.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:34
So these are very close connections.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:37
Um, with those plasma membrane proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:41
attached to each other, and they kind of look like a zipper when they're all put together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:45
So here you have the little purple, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:48
proteins that are attached to each other, just like we saw before.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:53
And this is how… this is a tight junction, because the proteins are specifically touching.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:58
Okay? They're touching each other, so they're…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:01
tight junctions. And you put them…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:04
Um, a bunch of them together, and it kind of looks like a zipper.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:08
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:10
So that's a tight junction.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:12
in between cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:15
And then lastly, we have a gap junction, which is just like it sounds. There's a gap in between.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:21
So, this is when there's two identical plasma membrane proteins joining, and if you look really close,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:28
And you can read it on here. What type of membrane protein are these guys?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:36
Anyone? What do you think?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:39
go back to the list of 6 proteins that we talked about before. Which one does this look like? It has a hollow kind of tunnel.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:47
in between each one.

[Marilyn Calderon] 18:47:51
Nice shadow partner.

[Melissa Quesada] 18:47:51
The channel protein

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:52
Yeah, it also says it right here. The channel proteins, the membrane channel.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:57
Okay? So that's two channel proteins that are connected to each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:02
And you have a tunnel on one and a tunnel on the other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:05
So, now it just makes one long tunnel.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:08
Uh, and a connection between these two cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:10
So that's a gap junction. And it makes sense, the tunnel, there's a gap, right? There's space.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:16
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:22
Thank you! Excuse me.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:25
So, those are the three types of junctions. So,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:29
Cells can come together,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:31
And they can touch each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:34
through proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:36
through protein junctions, okay? So the first is an adhesion junction,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:40
Where they're just… they're not… the proteins aren't touching specifically, but they're little filaments, these little, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:48
projections are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:49
And then you have a tight junction, which the two proteins are connected to each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:54
And then you have a gap junction, which specifically are two channel proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:59
connected to each other.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:01
And I should have mentioned this earlier, but obviously,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:04
On the right, the right, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:08
membrane, that's representing one cell, and the left membrane is representing a second cell. So these are two different cells coming together. These are the points of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:17
intersection between the two.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:21
Okay? So, know the difference between those guys, and then lastly, we have the same kind of concept, but for plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:30
So, these are specifically called… oops, sorry.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:33
These are specifically called Plasmodesmata.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:37
Okay? If we were in person, I would make you guys all repeat these after me.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:43
Um, because saying the words out loud are also helpful for remembering and for…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:50
um, spelling them and everything.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:53
But, anyway.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:57
Um, but yeah, so Plasma Desmata are plant cells that are connected by

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:03
Uh, sorry, so these are the narrow membrane line channels that pass through the cell wall. So remember this cell wall that we talked about earlier?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:12
these plasmodesmata, which if you look here, they're zoomed in, these are the, kind of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:19
it's kind of like a gap junction that we saw

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:23
in the animal cells, right? So there's, like, a gap in between. So these, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:29
gaps are the plasma desmata. They're kind of like narrow channels.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:34
And this allows for the exchange of materials through each of the cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:40
Right? Plants, um, all cells in general have to work together, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:45
plant cells especially have to work together, so they pass nutrients, um, throughout the cell.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:52
throughout the two cells. And they do it through these, um, junctions called plasmodesmata.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:58
So, when you think of plasmodesmata, think of PLA, think of plant. This happens in plants only.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:05
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:10
Okay, so that's it. This is a kind of a different table, not a different table. It is the table that you guys just made in your notes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:20
Um, they call this a description, but I prefer the function, so this is in your… in your textbook, but the one that you have in your notes, you can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:28
You can use this and add on top of it, but I would just do the one in your notes, because that's the easiest to remember, that's why I make you guys make your own tables.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:35
But it has, um, pretty much all of the organelles that, um,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:40
We covered today, and this is another reminder of the plasma membrane.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:45
That has the, you know, phospholipid bilayer, and it has all the other things in it. These proteins.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:50
Um, that we talked about. So this is just another visual to show you the proteins within the layer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:55
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:57
Do we have any questions for today?

[Lilian Valencia] 18:52:03
No, Professor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:05
No?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:08
Any questions?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:52:08
I have a question about the exam?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:12
Yeah, what's up?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:52:12
So, I… I saw that it's 50 questions.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:52:17
Yes? So, would you say that it's more, uh… it's a lot like, uh…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:52:22
The quizzes that we've been, uh, that we've had,

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:52:27
Plus…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:27
So, mhm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:29
Sorry, go ahead.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:52:30
No, plus, plus other, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:34
Yeah, plus more things. So, the exams, um, I do take a good amount of questions from the homeworks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:42
on the exams, but there are also a good amount of questions that aren't on the homework. So yes, it is… it is an addition.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:50
That's why I say try to get your homeworks done, you know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:54
As soon as you can, and you have to do both attempts on the homework.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:58
In order for you to see the right answers, right? If you just do the one attempt on the homework,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:03
Um, it'll give you a score, and it'll tell you what you got wrong, but it won't tell you the right answer. You have to do both of the attempts in order to see the right answer, so you can use that as a study guide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:13
So, yeah, I do take some of the questions directly from the homework.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:16
Um, but again, everything that I'm gonna test you on is gonna be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:21
things that I covered in class.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:23
So, the things on the homework that you might have had to look in the book and do some digging,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:28
that, you know, those are just more challenge questions for you to read through the book.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:33
Um, and to think about it, but I'm only going to be quizzing you, or testing you on things that I…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:39
went over in lecture. Does that make sense?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:53:41
Okay, because I did it twice, but I didn't see the correct answer. I'll go and look again.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:48
Okay, check and let me know, because then maybe it's a setting that I missed it or something. But yeah, please let me know.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:53:49
Um, is that there's one…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:53:51
Okay.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:53:54
Oh, alright. I don't… I don't know if anybody else have been able to see the answer, the right answer.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:00
Have you guys been able to see the right answers when you do the second attempt?

[Nicolas Lendaro] 18:54:03
Only the first one, the second one, no.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:54:06
Yeah, just to run it, and they run, uh, that is run, but not at the right answer.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:54:06
now, Professor.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:54:08
No.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:54:10
After the second attempt,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:10
No…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:54:13
Yeah, geez.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:54:13
we can… we can give you the… the answer, the correct answer.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:54:17
I was really? You had it?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:54:18
No, no, no, I can

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:54:19
Oh, okay, yeah, no, no, we haven't… I haven't been able to… that's why I wanted to… because that… the word…

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:54:20
No, no, no, I can't.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:54:26
There are questions that I don't…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:54:28
I looked, and I couldn't find the answer. Give me a try.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:31
Yeah, that makes sense. Let me see really quick.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:41
Feedback. After first attempt, show the scores, correct indicators. After the second attempt, or 100%.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:50
Hmm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:00
Question scores…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:55:01
One thing, though, when I try to go again and try to see if I… if I can read what the wrong answer was,

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:55:10
It shows that it's, like, I've done it once.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:55:14
But I actually did it twice.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:55:16
And it says that I still have one

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:55:19
Uh, more to go.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:55:23
I'm referring to the… Yeah, I did.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:23
But you did it twice? Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:28
Um… That's a separate issue, hold on one second. Okay.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:55:31
Uh-huh, yeah, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:33
Everyone, let me… let me relink this. Okay, I changed a setting…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:40
So everyone… Refresh your Canvas page.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:44
And go to the Assignment 1. And tell me if you can see the answers now.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:54
Just for Assignment 1, let me know if you guys can see.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:58
And Nicholas, I know you had your hand up, so… Can you guys see the answers, like, the correct answers? Harry says yes.

[Nicolas Lendaro] 18:56:06
It was… it was for that, about what she said. Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:07
Oh, it was. Okay, cool, perfect. So what can you see? You can see the right answers, and…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:16
Like, what you got wrong, right? Harry, what do you see?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:23
Sorry, I know you're eating. You could take them a name.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:29
Everyone else, can you guys see it?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:56:31
Yeah, no, in my case, it says incorrect,

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:56:35
Uh, but it doesn't…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:56:37
Yeah, it doesn't tell me what the right answer is. It says incorrect.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:42
Did you do both attempts?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:56:43
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:56:45
Yeah, you can see my two, um…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:56:51
the two grades that I got.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:53
Mm-hmm. That's so weird. We haven't had this issue before.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:04
What about everyone else? Can I get a thumbs up if you can see… the right answers, and Tonella, you can see. Can I get a thumbs up? Who can see?

[Antonella Diaz] 18:57:08
I can see my… Yeah, when it says view attempt, you click on view attempt, and then it takes me to the test, and it shows me all the ones I got right, and which ones I got wrong.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:21
Can you, um, fix your screen so it doesn't show, uh, blurry? And Martha.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:57:23
Well, pictures for Jesus.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:27
Look at Antonella's screen, and look what she's doing. Could you explain that again for the class? Sorry.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:57:32
I'm just trying to… I'm just trying to figure out how to turn off the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:38
Oh, I think if you go to video, and it has Blur My Background, just click that.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:57:41
Oh, yeah, no, I saw it. On the corner and the upper…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:57:46
Uh, right corner, it says show correct answers.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:51
Okay, perfect. So you guys can see it. Then, can you check that for Assignment 3?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:56
For anyone that's done it yet, can you check that as well? Because maybe the other setting I had was fine, too.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:01
You can't see it? Okay, got it. So I'll fix all of them for that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:06
And hopefully you guys will be able to see all of them.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:58:10
Where do you see that, that you can see the answer, the correct answer?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:58:13
When you click on the… so you… you go and take a look at the… the… the question, and it says if it's right or wrong, and then on the upper,

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:58:19
Yeah?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:58:24
right corner of the screen says, show correct…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:58:29
Uh, answering, and then you switch.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:58:35
And let me… let me share…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:58:38
Hold on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:41
Oh, I can… I can't… I can let you share, let me see.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:46
Oh, anyone can share. Go ahead, if you want to share your screen.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:58:47
Yeah, I can ask you.

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:58:50
Can you say much? See you over here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:54
There you go.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:59
Does everyone see that? How on the homework you can click… what Martha's showing?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:59:04
Here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:04
You can see the answers.

[Juan Santos] 18:59:13
Firstly, you can see the assignment one. You'll hit tweet.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:19
You can't see Assignment 1?

[Juan Santos] 18:59:21
Not

[Lilian Valencia] 18:59:22
Go all the way to the bottom of all the assignments, and I believe it's the part that says that it's past… Um…

[Lilian Valencia] 18:59:33
I believe when you see him go back.

[Juan Santos] 18:59:42
Yeah, he said the bottom of the screen.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:59:45
Yeah, it's all the way NSA's past assignment is all the way on the bottom.

[Juan Santos] 18:59:48
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:02
Great, does that make sense? I'm gonna refresh again and just check to make sure that you can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:12
C for Chapter 3, I'm gonna, like, relink the assignments. I did it for chapters 1, 3, and 4.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:27
Okay. Not everyone, go check your assignment 3. If you've done it, and you've done the two attempts.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:34
Some of you, a bunch of you haven't started yet, but… Um… Hopefully that's working for you, if hopefully you can see the answers, you should be able to by now.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:45
Um, if you're having issues, you can email me. But… anyway, that's it for class tonight. Um, make sure that you submit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:54
Your Chapter 3 assignment, try to do that as soon as possible.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:57
And, um, your chapter… for assignment as well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:01:04
Those are gonna be due…
