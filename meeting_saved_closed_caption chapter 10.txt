[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:46
passed down from the parent generation to the offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:50
Um, so he looked on… he looked at inheritance, yep, um, pea plants specifically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:56:58
add very easily identifiable traits. That's why he used them. So, he knew that there was

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:04
green, you know, pea color. There was a yellow pea color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:08
Uh, there's a white flower on the plant, or a red flower, or a purple flower.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:14
Um, there were tall ones, there were short ones, there's a bunch of different characteristics that were easily identified with this plant, and could easily be passed on.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:24
Um, are shown in the, you know, next generation offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:28
Um, his bottles were also compatible with the theory of evolution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:33
basically saying that there's various combinations of traits, right? Like, every organism has

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:38
bunch of different random traits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:41
And those traits are tested by the environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:44
So, whichever traits are the most successful.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:47
Um, allow that organism to survive and to thrive, so when they do that, they, you know, can have

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:54
a lot of resources, and they can have offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:57:58
And they pass on their good genes to the next generation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:03
Oops. That's a little bit of background. Um, we'll have a whole chapter on evolution, so don't worry about that for right now.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:11
Uh, for Mendel's work, this is, um, what he did for…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:16
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:17
studying these pea plants, um, a little bit of background on the anatomy first.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:22
So here is the flower, and here we have a stigma, which is this top of the thick green part here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:29
And then you have the ovary at the bottom.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:31
Those are the female reproductive organs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:34
And then the male reproductive organs are these little anthers here, the little yellow ones.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:40
at the top, the little yellow things, they produce pollen. So you guys have heard of pollen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:46
Um, the pollen is basically the equivalent of sperm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:50
So, it allows, um, the plants to, you know, pollinate other

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:55
of the same plant, but, you know…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:58:58
other individuals, and, um, they can pass on their genes that way. So that's kind of how…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:03
reproduction happens in plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:06
So what, uh, Gregor Mendel did is he cut away the anthers, so he took away

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:12
the, um, male reproductive part from the flower.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:16
Um, and he put…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:20
Pauline from another flower, from another plant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:23
Um, same… not the same pea plant, but the same species of plant, the pea plant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:28
And he used that, uh, pollen, and he put it on…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:33
um… the stigma of this flower. So, the pollen that he was putting could have been another, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:39
Another color flower, or another pea plant with a different trait, whatever he was looking at.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:44
So he basically just, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:48
cross two individuals, or he, you know, manually bred, or artificial…

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:52
artificially bred these two plants together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 17:59:56
Um, he can't… he kept super careful records, and he used, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:02
the laws of probability and also math to figure out, um, you know, the offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:07
So, he developed this specific theory called the particulate theory of inheritance.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:17
Sorry, my cat is crying. Um, he developed the, uh, particulate theory of inheritance, which is basically saying

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:25
That, from parent to offspring, there has to be these little things that get passed on,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:31
to the offspring that give the parents

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:34
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:39
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:40
I give the offspring, um, you know, the similar traits like the parents.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:45
So, he said it was the particulates, the particulate theory, so it's like little particulates, little things that are passed from parents to offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:53
Which we now know they are genes, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:00:57
The genes are in the DNA, and they are what make us who we are.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:01
So cool that he thought about that, and he knew that there was something going on before we could put a name on it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:08
So this is an example of all of the characteristics and the traits that these pea plants had. Um, the seed shape could be different, the pod should be…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:18
card shape could be different. The flower position on the plant, the color of the flower, etc. There's lots of different…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:25
things that you could look at.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:27
So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:30
Um, let's go into some…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:32
vocabulary, I guess, and some explanations of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:36
different types of alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:38
So, an allele is an alternative form of a gene.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:42
So we know a gene is a part of the DNA, so an allele is an alternative form of the gene, also a part of the DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:50
And it's basically, uh, accounts for certain traits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:01:56
or a certain trait in, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:00
in, uh, our genetics.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:01
So, there's two different types of alleles. There is a dominant allele,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:06
And the dominant allele has the ability to mask the expression of the other allele.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:11
Which is called the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:14
recessive allele.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:15
And the dominant allele

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:19
is denoted by an uppercase letter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:22
I know this will sound confusing, but once we, you know, cover the next couple slides, it'll make more sense.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:28
But a dominant allele has the uppercase letter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:32
Whereas the recessive allele, that has a lowercase letter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:37
Okay, so the recessive allele is the allele that, um, it's the trait that is covered or masked

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:45
by the dominant allele. So let's say in an individual,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:51
brown eyes is the dominant allele over blue eyes, which is the recessive allele.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:56
For example. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:02:59
the dominant allele is probably going to overpower the recessive allele.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:06
And this is an example of a Punnett square, which we'll talk about in a little bit, um, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:13
Basically, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:16
an allele can, uh, the dominant or the, um, recessive allele can

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:22
express certain traits, like I said. So the dominant allele in this example

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:28
is the green pod.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:30
For color, and the recessive is the yellow pod. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:35
a genotype, which we'll talk about sec- in a second, which is, like, basically

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:41
a representation of the alleles in an individual, so this

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:46
plant has the capital G, capital G genotype, which means it has two dominant alleles, so it's gonna be the dominant color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:55
These guys over here are both capital G, lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:03:59
But they do have a capital letter, and like we said, the capital letter is the dominant allele. So if the dominant allele is present, it's gonna be masking the recessive, so it's gonna be green.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:11
And then here, finally, we have two lowercase gs, um, in this individual, and because there's no dominant allele, the recessive allele

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:19
can come out. And in this case, the recessive allele

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:23
is yellow.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:25
And so we can see that here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:28
Okay. So, alleles, remember, are basically one letter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:33
Um, and when you have a group of alleles, there's two of them, that forms a genotype, which I'm going to talk about in just a second.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:41
So, here we are. The genotype…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:44
is the combination of alleles in an organism. So, a combination of alleles, it's two…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:50
alleles together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:52
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:55
Um, that's indicated by the letters, the two letters.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:04:59
Or, um, a short descriptive phrase. So, for example,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:04
Capital A, capital A, A is an example of a genotype, just like in the previous slide.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:09
We saw the G's, right? Capital G, capital G, lowercase g, lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:14
Um, those combination of the alleles are the genotype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:20
So, you can use any letter, by the way. It could be G, it could be A, it could be B.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:27
Z, whatever you want to do.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:29
That is the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:32
That's the, um, the genotype. So, it doesn't matter what letter, you can just use them for capital and for lowercase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:41
So, next…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:44
Um, the other type is called the phenotype, and the phenotype

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:48
is talking about the physical appearance of the individual.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:52
And the phenotype, how the physical…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:55
you know, individual looks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:05:57
is determined by the genotype. That makes sense, right? Genotype is talking about the genes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:02
The phenotype with the… with the beginning part, pH.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:07
That's referring to the physical, so that's, like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:11
color of something, or the height of something.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:15
It's more of a descriptive, you know…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:18
type of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:21
kind of category. So there's genotype, and then there's phenotype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:25
Okay? So within the genotypes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:29
But those letter combinations that I was talking about,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:32
There's only 3…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:35
Actually, there's only two types.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:37
There's 3 types, but there's, like, two categories. So, there's two types. Three types. Homozygous, which is when…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:44
There are two identical alleles for a trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:48
And Homo, we know, means the same.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:51
Uh, so homozygous means two of the same alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:55
So, that means capital A, capital A…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:06:59
or homozygous dominant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:02
Okay? So, if you have two capital letters as the genotype,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:09
You know it's homozygous because it's two of the same instead of it being

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:14
uppercase and lowercase,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:16
It's two of the same, either uppercase, uppercase, or lowercase, lowercase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:21
But then we see the word dominant, and we know that dominant is the uppercase letter, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:27
It's the capital letter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:29
So, homozygous dominant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:31
is capital A, capital A.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:34
Or, rather, capital A, capital A is homozygous dominant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:38
Whereas over here, we have lowercase a, lowercase a. We also know that's homozygous because it's the same.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:46
But it's a homozygous recessive, because it's the smaller lowercase letter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:52
Okay? Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:55
doubleton. I'm not happy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:07:58
Um, so that's homozygous.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:01
So then, the third type we have is heterozygous, and that's when there's two different alleles. So that's just the capital A and lowercase a.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:10
Hetero, the prefix hetero,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:13
means different. So hetero is the two different alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:18
So there's only 3 options. There's homozygous dominant, which is two capital letters,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:24
There's homozygous recessive, which is the two lowercase letters.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:28
And then there's heterozygous, which is the two different letters.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:33
For two different alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:36
Okay? Um, for example, this is a little table showing the genotype versus the phenotype for a specific example looking at

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:45
pigmentation in the skin, or skin color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:48
Uh, for example, the allele combination, capital A, capital A,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:53
is homozygous dominant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:08:56
And the phenotype, the physical trait that is associated with that, is the normal pigmentation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:03
Same thing for allele combination, capital A, lowercase a. We know that's heterozygous.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:10
And that's also normal. However, if we look at the lowercase a, lowercase a, the homozygous recessive,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:17
That is trait for albinism, or being albino, so that's the lack of pigment, or the lack of color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:24
Right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:26
So that's just one example. I'm gonna leave you with this slide for just a second. I'm gonna feed my cat really quick. I'll be back in 30 seconds, but make sure you guys know this slide really well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:37
Um, it's really…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:09:39
you know, key for this whole lecture, okay? So, take notes on this for a second, I'll be right back.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:45
Okay. Stop.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:49
That's genotype versus phenotype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:51
So now, let's look at one trait inheritance. So, like we know, Gregor Mendel

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:10:58
he crossed a true breeding plant, so this is the pea plant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:02
Um, it had, you know, known traits, and it had easy-to-follow traits, like the color of the pod,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:09
Um, the color of the flower, the height, the shape of the pod, things like that. Those traits that we looked at before.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:16
So, um, when I talk about, uh, the parental generation, I'm talking about the P generation, or if I'm talking about

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:24
the P generation. I'm talking about, um, the parental.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:29
Brandon has a question. So technically, you can have two traits from your mom,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:34
or two treats from your dad for eye color, height, etc.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:37
So, great question. This is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:41
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:43
Oh, someone else has zygus. What does zygus mean?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:46
So Zygies is of, like, the zygote. It's the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:51
like, at the cellular level, the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:53
the combination, basically. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:11:58
So I guess is, like, zygote. It's the combination from, like, the parent, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:04
like the egg and the sperm, basically, like, the combination of them. So, homozygous is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:09
from that allele, um, homozygous dominant, for example.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:14
um, homozygous scene.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:17
zygote, like, capital and capital. It's denoting the same allele.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:21
or the same zygote of the parents, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:24
Brandon's question, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:28
It's more complex than that. This is just the basics, basics of genetics, and these are general rules or laws that Mendel came up with, um, looking at these simple pea plants.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:39
But humans and other species, especially humans,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:43
are, um, much in certain instances, for certain traits, can be more complex.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:49
So, yes, in, uh, I believe brown eye color is dominant to blue eye color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:12:55
But as we'll talk about later in lecture, there's different…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:00
Um, other…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:02
genes and interactions with genes that have to happen for…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:06
a certain eye color to be produced, or, like, a certain height.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:09
So we'll talk about that in a second, but good question.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:13
So the P generation is the parental generation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:17
the F1 generation is the first generation offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:21
So the parental generation, we're talking about the parents, like, the first two

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:25
you know, ones that you breed.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:27
Um, and then their offspring is the F1 generation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:31
And then you cross the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:36
F1 generation together, and you get the second generation offspring. That's F2 generation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:41
So when you hear me talk about those, that's what I'm talking about.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:45
Um, Gregor Mendel…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:47
created the Punnett Square.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:50
as an illustration to help see, um, the types of…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:13:56
I guess, results of, um, crosses between individuals. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:02
These things can get pretty complicated, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:05
the general basis of the square is showing how genes are moving through the generations.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:11
And I want to bring up this photo again. This is a Punnett square.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:15
Okay, so I'm going to show you guys how to make these and how to go through them. They're pretty easy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:22
So, first off, we have, before you even make this, before you have any of this box, pretend it's a blank box.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:29
you have two individuals. This is one individual, and

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:34
the allele G with this allele G, this is one individual.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:37
So it's capital G, lowercase g, that's the genotype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:43
crossed…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:44
with this individual. So you see, that's the egg, that's the female, and this is the sperm over here. So this individual, the male, is capital G, lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:53
So that is the cross.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:14:56
So, for an example, like, on the exam or your homework, you can get asked, cross these two individuals.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:03
And it could be anything. It could be capital G, capital G…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:08
times lowercase g, lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:10
any of those combinations, okay? Any of those, you know, the three combinations that we talked about, you could go in here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:17
So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:19
you put, uh, these individuals

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:21
These are these guys, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:26
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:30
Okay, so now what you want to do is you put them on each…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:35
basically one allele or one letter on each kind of column or row.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:40
So once you have that set up, remember there's nothing in here. These are blank.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:44
So now you bring it down just like a little multiplication table. You bring down the big G, and you bring over

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:51
this big G. What do we have?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:54
Capital G, capital G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:15:57
Now, same thing, move over. Bring down this little G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:00
Bring over this big G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:03
What do we have? Capital G and a lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:07
Um, you always want to put the capital letter first, just that's how they…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:11
they order it. So, always make sure the capital letters first.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:14
Lower keys G, uppercase G is technically correct, but just the format of it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:19
Um, is the capital first.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:21
Okay, now we move down over here. Bring down this big G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:25
And bring over this little G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:28
Capital G, lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:30
And now, on the last one, bring down this lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:35
Bring over this lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:37
We get lowercase, lowercase.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:40
So, can someone remind me, what is the, like, phrase of the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:47
they, uh, genotype for capital G, capital G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:51
It's, like, two words.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:16:55
Two words, so homozygous is the first one, what's the second word?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 18:17:00
Dominant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:02
Dominant, yep. Homozygous dominant, so that's that one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:05
Someone else tell me what's the uppercase G, lowercase g? What is that one called? It's one word.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:17:13
Heter

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:15
Mm-hmm, heterozygous.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:17
So then the last one, lowercase g, lowercase g, someone else, tell me what that one is.

[Mia Farella] 18:17:25
Homozygous

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:28
Exactly. Homozygous recessive.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:31
Awesome. So this is a Punnett square.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:33
So that's basically how you make it. All you have to know is you just draw a square, like we can draw one here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:39
Drop… oops, yep, draw an empty square.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:44
And then do a cross in A.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:46
And then let's say for this individual, let's do the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:49
capital G, capital G times the lowercase g, lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:53
We're gonna put the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:56
One individual here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:17:59
And then the other individual here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:03
And then we're gonna go and do the crosses, and that's how you do it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:07
So I might ask you for that on…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:11
Um, on your exam.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:14
So you can have a sheet of paper,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:15
For the exam, if you need it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:17
Um, but anyway, that's how you do a Punnett square.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:21
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:24
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:32
Here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:32
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:35
So, now we're gonna look at across, just like we did before with these individuals, to get this same Punnett square.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:43
What we're going to look at the different generations.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:45
So here

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:46
So here we're going to cross in this orange box, this is the parental generation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:51
This is the first individuals, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:53
We're gonna cross this green pod, which has a genotype of capital G, capital G.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:18:58
Homozygous dominant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:00
And we're gonna cross it with this yellow pod, lowercase g, lowercase g,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:05
Homozygous recessive.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:07
So, according to a law that we're going to talk about, I think on the next slide…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:13
that manual figured out.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:15
one allele from each parent is going to be donated to the offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:20
Okay? So, this parent is going to give a capital G, and this parent's gonna give a lowercase g.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:27
So, the F1 generation…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:30
In this example, are going to be all heterozygotes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:35
But they're all gonna be green.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:37
Because they have the capital G for the heterozygote, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:41
So that's the F1 generation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:43
Now we're going to cross the F1 generation together, so we're gonna put these heterozygotes together, just the same Punnett square that we did before. I just took a little…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:53
mini screenshot of it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:19:54
So we have capital G, lowercase g, times capital g lowercase g, and we do the cross,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:00
And what Mendel figured out,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:02
was that when he crossed the F2, um, sorry, when he crossed the F1 generation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:09
Um, and got the F2 generation, the second generation offspring,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:13
Every single time he did this, he got a ratio of 3 to 1.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:19
That's the phenotypic ratio of the dominant

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:22
to the recessive.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:24
alleles. Okay? In this case, it's green and yellow. Green is a dominant, and yellow is recessive.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:33
So, that's a good exam question. When Mendel crossed the F1 generation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:40
Uh, plants together.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:42
What was the ratio of the F2 generation?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:46
Or some question like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:48
The ratio is 3 dominant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:51
to 1 recessive, or three green to one yellow in this example.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:56
And all of this just says what I just explained.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:20:59
Okay. So the F2 generation produced…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:04
3 to 1.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:11
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:12
Okay, so this is the law that I was talking about. It's called the law of segregation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:17
And it basically states that two, or excuse me, each individual

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:22
has two factors for each trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:24
When he's talking about factors, he's talking about alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:28
Okay, we know their alleles now, but when he created these laws,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:33
he didn't know what they were called. Like, he didn't… you know, alleles weren't…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:37
they weren't named alleles back then.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:40
So, each individual, for example, this dark… this green pod, and this yellow pod, they each have two factors for each trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:47
So for color, this green pod is homozygous dominant, and this one is homozygous because if they have two letters, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:21:57
The factors, or the genes, or the allele, excuse me, they're gonna separate or segregate

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:03
During the formation of the gametes. So, gametes…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:07
is the egg in the sperm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:09
They're the sexual cells.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:11
from each of the parents, right? The females produce the eggs, and the males produce the sperm, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:18
So the gametes, um, each get, you know, one allele, or each factor.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:25
or one factor, from each parent.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:29
Um, yeah, like we said, each gamete contains only one

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:34
you know, factor from each parent. So each parent donates one of their…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:39
Audience.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:41
fertilization of these allows for the creation of this F1 generation, which is a new individual,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:48
with both of the alleles that the parents donated.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:52
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:22:59
Um, so we have, uh, fertilization, which gave way to this new F1 generation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:05
So that's what the law of segregation

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:09
states, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:12
Sorry, one second.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:24
Okay, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:26
Um… yeah, that's the law of segregation. Law of segregation, or law of separation.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:31
Um, it's just the separation of

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:35
the alleles during the formation of the gametes, and that's just the parent donating basically one allele.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:43
to their offspring.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:45
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:48
That's one of Mendel's laws that you guys have to know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:52
And then this is just to point out and show where these alleles are visually on the chromosomes, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:23:59
So these are chromosomes that we have, and they're full of our DNA.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:02
And these alleles that we have that represent certain traits that make us who we are,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:07
are found on the chromosomes. So you can see these pairs of alleles here. Let's look at this red one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:13
We have this capital G, capital G, that's one of them.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:17
We have these orange, capital R, capital R, and the same thing on the blue, lowercase r, lowercase r.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:23
We have S, T, whatever. These are the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:26
genotypes that…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:28
um, are connected to certain alleles or certain traits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:32
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:35
Yeah, so that's just to show you where they are in the chromosome, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:39
And again, this is one chromosome, and you have the two sister chromatids connected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:44
at the centromere, which is that middle spot.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:48
I think I talked about that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:51
Last chapter? Yeah, last chapter.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:24:54
Okay, so now we have two trait inheritance. This is a… an extension from…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:01
his one-trait inheritance.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:03
So, what Mendel did was he crossed these true breeding plants

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:07
that differed in two traits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:10
So, he was just working with the pea plants that differed in one trait, meaning they were all the same,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:16
Except for one trait, so maybe the flower color was different, or maybe the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:22
um, pod color was different.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:24
Right? But now, he wanted to see, okay, these are two plants that

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:29
Uh, or these are plants that they're differing in two traits. So, for example, you have a short plant with a yellow seed,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:36
And you have a tall plant with a green seed.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:39
So, now we have different heights, and we have different seeds.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:46
So what he found…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:50
was that for, uh, different phenotypes emerged from this cross.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:25:55
So, remember, phenotype is the physical appearance.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:00
So, he found 4 different ones that came from this cross.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:04
He got short and yellow, which is what he started with.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:09
He got short and green.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:11
From the green seeds,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:13
He got tall and yellow.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:16
And then he got tall and green.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:19
So what he figured out from this was the law of independent assortment. Independent means on your own, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:27
So each pair of factors, so each trait, basically, whether it's be the height or the color,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:34
assorts independently of the other pairs. So you can have all possible combinations of factors that happen

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:43
in the gametes. So, it's not just that short plants with yellow seeds,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:48
will only produce short plants with yellow seeds. It's that short plants with yellow seeds can produce a short plant with a different color seed,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:26:56
or it can be a yellow seed with a different height of plant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:01
Does that make sense to you guys?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:04
Do you have 4 different phenotypes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:07
coming from…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:09
you know, two different individuals, because there's four different alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:13
that are involved with this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:15
And he's just saying that these alleles

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:19
aren't, you know, paired. They're not sticking with each other to go to the next offspring. They're separated, so you can have any combination of

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:29
Short, tall, yellow, green, or, you know…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:32
Purple flower, white flower, whatever. Yeah, Brandon.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:27:37
Yeah, I'm just a little confused because… The way you explain one-trait inheritance, it was like… There's two parties involved.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:27:46
like, kind of, like, looking at, like, from a human standpoint, like, a mom and a dad giving the traits to… Their offspring, but now you're talking about a 2 trait inheritance, and I'm a little confused. Is that, like.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:27:50
Mm-hmm.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:28:01
four different… plants giving, like, one offspring? Like, I'm… can you just elaborate?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:28:08
on that a little bit.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:09
So, to trait, it means that the plants differed in two traits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:15
the two traits are height,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:17
and seed color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:21
Does that clear it up? So, two different traits this plant had.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:26
height, so it could be short or tall, and then the color would be yellow or green.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:28:26
Oh, okay.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:28:32
Okay, I see, I see. Okay, I had a whole other different definition. Alright.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:36
That's okay. So the single tree is all the plants are exactly the same, same height, same color, same whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:44
But they differ in one trait. So, like, let's say the flower color is different.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:48
But the pod colored and all the other stuff is the same.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:51
But they just differed in one trait. So that's how he could test and see how they were moving through the generations.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:28:54
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:28:57
Because they were the same exact plant, except for one difference. But now, we have the same exact plant, except for two differences.

[Brandon Montejo] 18:29:04
So, in a way, it's kind of like… I would say, like, a mutation?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:05
Make sense?

[Brandon Montejo] 18:29:11
Per se, would you say it's kind of like…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:13
No.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:15
No, it's not really a mutation. Try not to compare this with humans yet, we'll get there, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:21
Um, this is just more so just the plants, looking at the basic

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:26
like, laws of inheritance of, like, how genes generally

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:31
change. Like, yes, this can happen in humans in certain traits,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:36
But it doesn't happen, like, it's not so black and white for, you know, for humans. Obviously, there's, like, a million different genes and things, so…

[Brandon Montejo] 18:29:43
Yeah, of course. Alright, thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:44
Yeah. But I like where you're thinking. Good ideas. Thanks.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:49
Okay, so now let's see how his laws apply to humans and some of the exceptions to the law, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:29:58
Humans always have exceptions to things.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:01
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:02
So, first off, we're gonna look at pedigrees. So, a pedigree is basically a chart

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:09
Um, that describes…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:11
Um, a specific gene or a specific trait,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:16
Um, looking at it in a family tree.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:19
Okay? So, first off, a little vocab. An autosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:24
is any chromosome other than the X and the Y chromosome. So the X and the Y chromosome are the sex chromosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:31
And the autosomes are all the other ones.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:33
So, humans have 22…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:38
pair, excuse me, 23 pairs of chromosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:42
But one of those payers is the sex chromosome, that's the X and the Y chromosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:48
So, they have 22 pairs of autosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:54
Okay? This is important because certain

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:30:57
traits or certain diseases, or genetic disorders,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:02
can impact the autosomes, or they can impact the sex chromosomes, the X and the Y.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:08
Okay? So the X and the Y are the sex chromosomes that determine your gender, basically.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:14
Genetically, and um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:17
the autosomes are the rest of the chromosomes, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:22
So, that will make sense for the next slide. But a pedigree, like I was saying, it's a chart of the person's family history, but it's only talking about one specific trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:32
So every pedigree that you see, it's describing a specific trait, which can

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:38
you know, have an effect on the autosome or the sex chromosome, depending on what it is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:44
So there's certain ways that you read them, and um… first off, the males, so it's a male and female that are depicted on the chart,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:52
a bunch of them throughout the family, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:55
Males are designated by the squares,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:31:58
And the females are designated by…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:01
the circles. So, if you see a square, it's gonna be a male, and if you see a female,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:09
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:13
it's gonna be a circle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:18
Okay,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:21
The shaded colors are gonna be those individuals that are affected by this genetic trait. So they are positive for that trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:30
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:35
And… yeah, so that's shaded, that's, um, it's gonna be green in the chart that we look at.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:43
And then the lines connecting all the individuals, that just shows, like, how they're related. So, horizontal lines,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:50
usually mean to individuals that were together,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:54
And then, uh, vertical lines going down means children, and then the siblings are also horizontal lines.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:32:59
But let me just show you what this looks like. So this is one example of a pedigree.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:05
And this pedigree is showing an autosomal

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:08
recessive trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:09
So, autosomal means it affects

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:13
Um, some other chromosome that's not the sex chromosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:17
And it's recessive, okay? So this is a trait that is easily…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:22
I already fed him, okay? Is easily…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:26
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:27
you know, covered by the dominant trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:31
So, let's take a look at this. So, let's look at the first generation here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:35
We have, um, the female here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:38
And she is affected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:40
She's shaded in, she has this autosomal recessive

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:45
disease, or…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:47
trait, or whatever it is, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:49
Um, it doesn't just have to be diseases, but…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:52
That's usually what they're for. And then the, uh, person she mated with, this male,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:33:57
is, uh, clear. So you see this white…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:01
you know, it's white, it's not shaded in. He is not affected by this disease.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:07
Um, looking at the key here, you see that lowercase a, lowercase a,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:12
is when the person is affected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:15
So, the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:18
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:20
what is it? The homozygous recessive, that's the one that's affected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:23
If you look down,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:26
at, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:28
The next one, we have the capital A, lowercase a,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:32
And those guys are normal, so they're not affected, because that dominant trait is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:38
you know, masking the recessive one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:40
However, these are called carriers, because they have the potential

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:47
to, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:49
you know, have this trait show up, because they have this little lowercase a.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:34:55
And then, after that, we basically just have more normal, um, individuals. So anything with more than one capital, it's gonna be… it's gonna be normal. Sometimes the other allele

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:06
is unknown, and that's… we don't have to worry about that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:14
So, this is autosomal recessive, so let's look at this. We have these two parents,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:20
They're in a union, they had two kids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:24
They had one…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:27
Someone tell me, did they have a son, or did they have a daughter?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:30
this individual here.

[Antonella Diaz] 18:35:34
Heterozygous?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:36
daughter. This is a female.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:38
And then over here, they had another daughter. So they had two daughters.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:43
And the daughters ended up to be heterozygotes, or heterozygous. So, capital A, lowercase a.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:49
Let's look at this daughter first. This daughter…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:51
mated with a male, and he is unaffected also.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:35:55
So, unaffected, unaffected, they had 3 kids that were unaffected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:00
Let's look at this daughter over here.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:02
We have an unaffected daughter and an unaffected…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:06
Um, mail over here, they had one daughter who was unaffected, but was a carrier.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:13
And this dot… this sun over here…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:16
from this other group is a carrier as well.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:19
So, now if we see this…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:23
female, who's a carrier, mated with this male who's a carrier,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:27
So now we have the chance to introduce the gene back in, the, um, the trait back in.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:35
So this male and this female

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:38
had 3 offspring, 2 daughters and 1 male,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:41
But two of them, the daughter and the son, are affected. They have this trait now.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:48
it popped back up in the family tree.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:51
So, obviously, this is, like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:53
you know, cousins mating together to have kids, which obviously shouldn't happen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:36:58
But, um, when you think about, like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:01
In history, like royal families of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:05
you know, having to marry royalty and making sure that you…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:09
Keep the bloodline and whatever. People would marry their, like, second, third, fourth cousin.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:15
And that's why they have a lot of genetic, you know, issues, and they have a lot of health problems, because

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:20
You're not supposed to be mating with your family, but anyway.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:24
Um, so that's how things like this can pop back up.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:28
And have adverse, you know, health issues.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:32
But the point is, this is relatively rare, because it is recessive, and you have to have certain conditions for this to happen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:40
On the other hand, this is a autosomal dominant pedigree.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:44
Where we see… let's look at the top here, the mom and the dad.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:49
They're both affected, okay? They're heterozygous.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:52
And let's look at the key. So, since this is a dominant,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:56
Um, pedigree.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:37:59
The individuals that have the dominant traits are affected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:02
So, we have capital A, capital A, homozygous dominant, they're affected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:06
Heterozygous are affected.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:08
Uh, the capital A with the unknown is obviously affected, and then the only ones that are normal

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:14
are the recessive ones.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:17
So that's the lowercase a, lowercase a, those are normal.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:20
So, looking at these parents…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:22
They are affected, and they're heterozygotes, heterozygose.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:27
Yeah. They have 4 kids, and 2 of them are affected, and 2 of them are not.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:33
So, we have two that are affected, male and female.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:36
And this male, who is a heterozygote,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:39
He meets with a recessive, a normal person.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:44
However, he's affected, and he has the dominant trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:47
So that means he can still pass on that dominant trait to his kids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:38:52
It could be a dominant disease, it could be a trait, whatever it is. But he could pass it on because he has it. Even though he made it with a recessive

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:00
partner. He can still pass it on to his kids. The only way that you don't pass it on is if you have a recessive, unaffected,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:08
individual mating with another recessive, unaffected individual.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:12
And they have all unaffected recessive kits.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:16
Okay? So it's just showing you how easy it is for the dominant trait to go through generations. It can over-mask the recessive one pretty easily,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:26
Unless you have the recessive…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:29
Um, unaffected individual.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:31
meeting with other recessive unaffected individuals.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:35
Okay? So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:38
I'm not gonna ask you anything too complex about this, just general rules, like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:43
you know, the circles, those are females, the squares are males, the shaded…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:48
you know, sections, those are the affected individuals.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:39:51
And then I might put a picture of one of these and say, you know, is this autosomal dominant, or is this autosomal recessive? And you guys know the difference now.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:01
Oh, not too bad.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:03
Everyone good on pedigrees? Does that make sense? Can I get a thumbs up from everybody?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:07
Make sense?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:12
Awesome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:14
Okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:17
So, now I'll just show you some examples of these genetic disorders. So…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:23
Some examples of those autosomal recessive disorders…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:27
Uh, like this, you know, pedigree on the left,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:30
Those include sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, and I can never pronounce this one.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:36
I'll cap tonuria.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:38
Um, but these are classic examples of autosomal recessive disorders.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:43
So, people who have this disorder don't want to mate with others that have this disorder.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:40:51
Um, because they can pass it on to their kids. They could mate with anyone else who doesn't have this, and their kids will likely be fine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:00
But if they, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:02
made with another recessive…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:04
individual who has this disorder, then they're gonna pass it on to their kids.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:12
Um, and some examples of the autosomal dominant are osteogenesis imperfecta, brittle bones, and Huntington's disease.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:21
So these, you have to be really careful with, because if you mate with another person,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:27
With it or without it, there's a chance that you are gonna pass it on to your kids, a very high chance.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:34
So there's oftentimes when…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:37
Um, individuals who have these kinds of diseases

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:42
may decide not to have kids because they don't want to pass on certain diseases or whatever it is to their kids, especially if it's autosomal dominant.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:41:51
If it's recessive, they have options, um, you know, to genetically test with their partner and see if they have a chance to pass it on to their kids. But if you have a dominant disorder,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:02
More likely than not, you're gonna pass it on to your offspring. So many couples may just choose not to have children, they may choose to

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:10
adopt or, you know, whatever.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:12
So anyway, those are just some examples.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:15
Okay, so now we're going to look at the exceptions to the rule, uh, before we were just talking about Mendel's laws.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:21
In relation to humans, now we'll look at them

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:24
with some example, uh, some exceptions to Mendel's laws in regards to humans.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:30
So, we have something called incomplete dominance that is when the phenotype, or the physical appearance, right,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:39
That's produced, um, from a crossing is the, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:44
heterozygote, or the, basically, combination of the two homozygotes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:50
So, the dominant allele does not completely mask the recessive allele.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:42:56
So, it's a perfect example, a red flower mates with a white flower,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:01
And instead of the red flower taking over, it's incomplete. It doesn't fully dominate the white color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:08
So we have a pink flower, that is the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:11
offspring. Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:13
This is just one example, this happens a lot in nature.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:16
Um, but it's not always black and white in that the dominant color takes over the recessive.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:23
Okay, this can happen in nature, where it's just…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:25
Um, you get different varieties.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:28
And that pink color

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:31
may meet with another white one, and then they can go on to be pink and white, or maybe they go back to red, it just depends.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:37
But… it's not always, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:41
in most cases, the dominant

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:44
machine over, or the dominant allele overpowers the recessive one, but sometimes it doesn't.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:49
That's why we have so much variety.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:51
In life. So that's incomplete dominance. The dominance was not able to fully take over the recessive.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:43:59
Um, so here's another example of an exception to the rule. Multiple, uh, alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:05
can be on different genes, so many genes can have multiple alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:10
And each of those can produce a different phenotype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:14
A good example of this is blood type.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:17
So, here we have interactions of 3 different alleles to determine someone's blood type.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:24
You either have the A antigen,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:26
You have the B antigen, or you have neither.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:30
So here's a little Punnett Square showing that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:33
So here is a parent that has the B antigen and a neither.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:38
as their genotype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:40
And then here is a parent that has the A antigen and a neither.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:45
So when you put these genotypes on a Punnett Square, like we all know how to do now,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:50
You get a IA and IB coming together,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:44:55
That makes blood type AB, so they have the A antigen and the B antigen.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:01
And you get AB.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:03
You have the eye, which is the neither, and the B coming together. That makes blood type B.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:10
You have the A coming together and the I, that makes blood type A.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:13
And then if you have neither, that's O, blood type O.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:18
Okay, so this is an example where multiple alleles, so in this case 3 alleles instead of the normal 2,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:26
can affect the phenotype of the offspring. And this phenotype in this example is the blood type.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:32
Okay, because it physically shows up in the blood. What type of antigens are present or absent?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:39
So, multiple allele traits. There can be more than two.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:44
So that is one example.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:48
Another example is polygenic inheritance. So, polygenic are traits that are governed by multiple genes, and each of those genes have several sets of alleles.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:45:59
So these are traits that have…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:03
multiple genes and multiple alleles associated with it, meaning…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:07
There are a lot of factors to determine what trait that is.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:13
One of these is…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:15
Height, okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:17
So, each allele that is connected with that gene can have an effect on the phenotype, on the trait.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:24
And in this example, it's height.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:27
Um, the…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:29
kind of distribution of this type of inheritance is something called a bell curve distribution.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:38
So, for this height example,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:42
Most people are of a general height, right? Like an average height. There's average.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:47
Um, in this example, it's about 65 inches to 71 inches. I want to say that's, like,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:46:55
5'5 or 5'3 to, like, 5'7 or 5'8", something like that.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:01
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:03
That's general height. So, below that, there are some individuals that are shorter than that,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:09
But it's very rare, right? There's fewer individuals that, on average, that are shorter. Just like there's fewer individuals on this side of the spectrum that are taller.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:19
Right? There's people that are within a certain range,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:23
of height, they're of average height, but then there's less people that are really tall, and there's less people that are really short.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:30
Right? So, these types of traits are governed by multiple genes and multiple alleles, so there's a lot of different interactions with these to determine the height. A lot of different factors go into it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:43
Another factor that can affect us is the environment.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:46
Okay, so the environment can play a role.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:48
in your height. So, when you were younger,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:47:52
And, you know, when they say, eat your vegetables, it'll make you big and strong, it's true, your vegetables and your fruits, all those good things that we talked about,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:00
Um, in Chapter 8.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:03
those things have essential vitamins and minerals and nutrients that can help you grow at when you're younger.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:09
So you can help you reach your full potential of your height, of your strength,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:15
of, you know, your just health, it can kind of set the tone for the health of your life.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:20
Um, if you are malnourished or undernourished, and you're just eating, you know,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:25
pasta, potatoes, like, basic things, chicken, you know.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:29
if you're not having diversity and you're not having a lot of fruits and vegetables in your diet, you're not… of course, you're still growing, but you're not reaching your full potential. And in extreme cases,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:40
Um, you can be undernourished or malnourished. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:44
But that's one way that the environment can…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:47
you know, the environment while you're eating, that can play a role.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:51
in, um, in your height. So that's polygenic inheritance.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:48:58
And then, I think this is one of the last ones, we have gene interactions. So, genes can also interact together to produce a certain phenotype, and this is where eye color comes in.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:09
Eye color is an example of an epistatic interaction. This is a specific one, where one gene can override another gene.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:17
So, this kind of sounds like dominant versus recessive, but it's not. It's not an allele.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:23
that takes over another allele, it's a gene that's like a dominant gene that can override another gene.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:31
Okay? Um, the gene is the bigger picture, it's the more, you know, foundational one. Allel's just, like, one example or a different type of a gene.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:40
So, eye color, like I said, can be influenced by this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:44
That's why there's multiple pigments.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:46
And factors like eye structure can also be, uh, playing roles in how

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:52
you know, what eye color you have.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:54
So, there's lots of different eye colors.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:49:57
There's General Brown and Blue, right? But there's also green, there's hazel,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:03
There's gray, some people have really, really dark brown eyes, some people have more, like, amber, lighter brown eyes, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:11
So, there's lots of different…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:13
factors that can affect this in a lot of different genes that can impact this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:18
Um, so it's not just that, oh, my parents have brown eyes, so I'm gonna have brown eyes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:23
It depends on, you know, family history, and it depends on a bunch of different genes.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:50:28
What is the reason, Professor?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:29
Like, for example…

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:50:32
That there's one?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:32
Sorry?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:50:34
What is the… handsome, no? Did you say?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:50:38
Individual… what…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:38
Hazel. Hazel is… is this one. It's… it's, like, green with brown on the inside. I have hazel eyes, you cannot tell from Zoom.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:50:42
Ah, this one.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:50:47
I still have this…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:49
Yeah?

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:50:50
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:51
Yeah, that's awesome. Um, but yeah, they're… they're just, like, green with, um…

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:50:52
Mm-hmm.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:57
With the little brown on the inside.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:50:59
Um, I was gonna say, like, my family…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:02
Everyone in my family has brown eyes, like my grandparents.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:06
Um, I guess my grandma had brown eyes, and then all of my family had

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:10
brown eyes, but my grandpa, Miauelo, he had…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:14
blue eyes, and everyone in my family has brown or green, you know, some, like, darker color.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:19
But then my cousin is the one in the whole family that has the blue eyes from

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:24
are abuelo. So, it's… it's a lot of different factors, including family,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:29
you know, um, family history, but it's not just like, oh, my parents have blue eyes, so I'm gonna have blue eyes. Like, it's a lot of different genes that are involved with that.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:51:38
Yes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:39
For sure. Okay, I think this is the last one. Pleotropy is when one single gene has more than one effect.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:48
Okay? So this is looking at, um, syndromes. So, syndrome is when

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:54
Uh, you have a group of symptoms that appear together,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:51:58
And this happens because of a specific

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:01
genetic… usually it's a genetic mutation that happens.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:05
So, a good example of this is Marfon Syndrome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:09
Where, um, this causes abnormal connective tissue and lack of fibrillin to produce elastin.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:15
So, in our bodies, we have a lot of connective tissue.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:19
It sounds kind of vague, but it's the tissue that connects everything in our bodies. It's between our muscles, it's between our skin, it's around our organs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:35
Sorry, thanks. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:38
Um, so connective tissue is everywhere around us, and it has a lot of, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:43
kind of stretchy elastic fibers called elastin, um, that's produced by this.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:49
Um, cell called fibrillin.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:52:55
Can you guys turn off your audio? I don't know whose audio is on right now.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:00
Thank you. Oh.

[Vaughn Clarke] 18:53:02
America's largest triangle.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:09
Okay, we got it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:13
Um, anyway, so…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:17
connective tissue. So, characteristics of this syndrome…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:21
include disproportionately long arms and long legs.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:25
Um, a weakened aorta, so your aorta is, um, one of the valves that pump blood in your heart.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:32
And it's full of, um, elastin. It has to be very stretchy, right? Because it has to pump all that blood, just like all the blood vessels in our body.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:41
They have to be very elastic to pump that blood.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:45
And then lastly, they also have poor eyesight.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:47
So… oops.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:49
there was, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:52
Yeah, so basically, it's Marfon Syndrome,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:53:55
It's a syndrome, it's a… it's a culmination of many different…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:01
symptoms that come together

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:09
Guys, make sure you have your audio off, please. Thank you.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:14
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:15
It's a syndrome which is a combination of lots of different symptoms,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:20
And, um, they might seem like they're not…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:24
you know, it's one gene that has more effect. It has one gene that is affecting multiple parts of the body. It's affecting the connective tissue, which can impact how long your arms are.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:33
It can impact your heart, like I said, with the aorta.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:37
And there's also elastin in our eyes, so it can also affect your eyesight and give you poor eyesight.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:42
So, again, just one gene having more than one effect in the body. That's pleiotropy.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:51
Okay, so now we're at the last part of the lecture, sex-linked inheritance, um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:54:56
And this is super short, but it's basically showing, um, what chromosomes we get from our parents.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:02
So, both males and females, we have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:07
23 pairs means 23 times 2, right? So we have 46 total chromosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:14
What we just learned earlier, 22 pairs are autosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:18
And the other pair, the one pair, is a sex chromosome, and that determines if you're male or if you're female.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:26
So, males have the XY chromosome,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:29
And females have the XX chromosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:33
So, looking at this image here,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:35
we have this mom, and we have this dad,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:38
And each of them have 44 autosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:41
Okay? Or 22…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:43
excuse me, 22 pairs of autosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:47
And the mom has an XX chromosome, that's her sex chromosome,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:51
And the dad has an XY chromosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:53
Okay?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:55:56
So, the mom is gonna donate in her egg, she's gonna donate 22 of their autosomes,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:03
And she's gonna donate one of her X chromosomes, because that's all she has. She can only give an X chromosome, because that's all she has.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:10
The dad, on the other hand, gives 22 of his autosomes, and he can either give an X or a Y chromosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:18
Okay? So, what determines…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:21
This is what determines the sex of the child. So, the daughter here…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:25
Got 22 autosomes from her mom,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:28
22 autosomes from her dad,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:30
And she got an X chromosome from her mom, and an X chromosome from her dad. So she is XX, which is female.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:39
The sign over here got the X chromosome from his mom,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:43
And the Y chromosome from his dad, so he is XY, he is a male.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:47
And of course, he has the 44.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:49
Autosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:52
Okay? So the parents each give…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:56:55
you know, whatever they have to give. The dad can offer either X or Y, and the mom can only offer an X.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:02
She's only XX, right?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:05
So that's sex-linked inheritance. So you can have inheritance from your parents based on the sex. Yes, Lillian.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:57:14
Is it true that the male is the one that…

[Lilian Valencia] 18:57:17
pick the sex of the baby.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:57:20
Good question, Lilia.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:23
kind of how I just explained it, yeah, that kind of seems like that's what it is. Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:29
That's a good question. I mean…

[Lilian Valencia] 18:57:29
Because I see they have more, like, we only have…

[Lilian Valencia] 18:57:33
I'm just gonna say it like that. XX, but they have XY, so they are…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:38
Mm-hmm.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:57:39
They have more than… I mean, if you want to see it like that, they have an extra one, then…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:42
Yeah.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:44
Technically, yeah, because the female, she only has the X to give, so yeah, I guess the male does determine

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:57:51
The sperm does determine what sex the baby is, whether it's a male or a female. So yeah, I guess technically they do.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:00
Good question.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:03
Um, and then lastly, uh, this is a chart of how we can see all of our chromosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:09
um, spread out. So, chromosomes, like we know, they kind of form an X kind of shape.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:14
And this is a pretty lab image from the laboratory, um, of a person's complete set of chromosomes, and that's called a karyotype.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:25
So, this karyotype…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:27
Um, shows the… all the chromosomes and their numbers, so 1 to 22. Those are the autosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:35
And then here you have the X and the Y chromosome.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:39
So, someone tell me, is this individual a male, or is this a female?

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:47
It's a male, yep, because he has the X and Y chromosomes.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:50
So, these chromosomes are numbered because there's certain chromosomes that can have certain… are known to

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:58:58
Um, maybe be affected by certain diseases. So, if there's a mutation,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:04
I forgot which one it was, it might be number 13, um, but if there's a special mutation on chromosome 13,

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:12
Um, then there's a chance that your child could have autism.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:16
So, it just depends. There's, you know, different mutations on different ones can cause certain…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:22
genetic disorders or diseases.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:25
Um, yeah, so that can be tested genetically.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:59:29
The number 13 is the, uh…

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:29
But yeah.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:59:32
the kids that I have autism.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:36
I could be wrong about that, I'm not sure, but there's one of those that are mutated, um, that when it's mutated,

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:59:38
Oh, good.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:43
it can… it can cause autism in children.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:59:46
Oh, okay.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:47
Like, they're just born that way. They have a mutation with it.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:51
Um, but I don't know, it might be number 13, but it might not be. I have to look it up.

[Yusimi Rojas Ramirez] 18:59:56
Yadi.

[Olivia Schuitema] 18:59:57
Okay, so that's it.

[Lilian Valencia] 18:59:59
So then… I'm sorry, so that means any other number in there, it could be, like, a normal child?

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:00
I'm gonna… you're fine.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:07
Um…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:09
I'm gonna stop the recording.

[Lilian Valencia] 19:00:09
I mean…

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:11
Um, if there's any other number… what'd you say, sorry?

[Lilian Valencia] 19:00:15
Yeah, like, from the chart that you're just showing there.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:17
Mm-hmm.

[Lilian Valencia] 19:00:18
there is any… like, if would be any other number in there, it would be, like, normal child.

[Olivia Schuitema] 19:00:23
It's not a number
