[Alejandro Lorenzo] 18:10:15
Good afternoon, everybody. Sorry

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:11:02
Hey, everybody. I'm sorry about that earlier, uh, just give me 2 minutes, and we'll get started very shortly.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:14
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, my apologies for starting late.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:19
My apologies, that was the con… my conversation you were hearing. I'm actually just leaving the urgent care. I've been here since, like, 3.30. I have a…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:27
serious ear infection, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:28
the oil the doctor was talking about was to lubricate my, uh, my earlobes. So anyway, my apologies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:34
I am, um, gonna start class.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:37
I'm not gonna put my video on just yet, because I'm driving, and I'll be driving for about 10 minutes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:43
Um, and then I'll have access to a laptop, so I can go ahead and show our class lecture and presentation for this evening.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:50
But, um, what we're gonna do tonight is, um, we're gonna talk a little bit about the history

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:22:57
involved in, uh, the milestones that led to the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:02
Really, the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:04
Declaration of Independence from Great Britain, um, and then eventually the ratification of the United States Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:12
So we're going to focus specifically on those very important key milestones.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:16
that, uh, were involved in really shaping our country's history up to the point.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:22
of independence from Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:24
And then talk about what happened, uh, after we declared ourselves

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:29
independent from Great Britain, that period of time.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:32
during the American Revolution, when we were battling

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:35
with Great Britain for our independence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:37
Subsequently winning the American Revolution, and then subsequently…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:42
putting in place, ratifying the Constitution of the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:46
And that'll set us up nicely for

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:49
Uh, the work that we'll do in the second part of the semester, which will focus on the Constitution itself,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:54
We'll take a look at the preamble.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:23:57
7 articles and the 27 amendments in great detail.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:01
Um, so, but in order to understand why those are in place,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:05
It's important to understand a little bit of the history involved in

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:10
why and what got us there.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:12
All right, so again, in about 10 minutes, I will have access to my laptop. I will then present you with the, uh, with the PowerPoint for tonight's discussion, but I think I can get started

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:24
Uh, and just kind of narrate a little bit about the history involved, uh, you know.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:30
that early part of that history that led to the Declaration of Independence. All right, so let's start at the beginning.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:36
our beginning, right? The U.S. is beginning, we started as colonies,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:40
of Great Britain, as you all know.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:42
Um, that colonization of this new land for Great Britain occurred in the 1600s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:50
We know the story, especially around Thanksgiving time. We'll hear about the pilgrims that settled at Plymouth Rock.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:56
You know, in what is Massachusetts?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:24:58
Uh, and about the plight of those pilgrims as they settled into colonial life.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:04
And, um, you know, organize themselves and, uh, integrated with the Native Americans who were already here.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:12
So we know that story from Thanksgiving, right? It was a group of individuals from Great Britain who came over,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:19
And we're part of that early colonization.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:23
They were supported by the king at the time. In fact,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:27
really around the world, there were a couple of superpowers whose mission at the time was to expand their colonial bases as much as possible.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:37
The thinking being that the more land a country controlled, the more people it controlled.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:42
And the more people they controlled, then the greater and faster your empire.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:47
So the superpowers at the time, Great Britain, of course, Spain,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:51
France, Portugal, China,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:25:54
Those were the main players in the 1600s, right? And each one of those countries, um, set a course

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:01
for new lands to conquer.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:03
And you can kind of, you know, look at current…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:07
colonies around the world, and kind of see where they're, uh, you know, history stems from, right? So that we know that…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:14
Spain, for example. They did a really great job

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:18
of coming to the West.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:20
And they colonized a good portion of lands west of them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:25
Certainly the Caribbean, right? We know that Spain colonized what is Puerto Rico.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:31
What is the Dominican Republic? What is Cuba?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:34
Um, to the north of that,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:37
They colonized a good portion of what was called the Merica at the time, right? That Columbus had discovered in the late 1400s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:45
Um, they had colonized, you know, an area that is where we live,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:49
Florida, right, was a colony of Spain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:52
Um, they colonized, um, you know, all the way down the borders.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:26:58
of what is current-day Texas.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:01
Arizona, Nevada, California, Montana, Colorado,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:05
you know, any of those current states that have a name that's

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:09
Spanish, Montana, of course, Montana, you know, mountain in Spanish. Colorado, Cororado, which is red.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:16
in Spanish. Arizona, which is arid in Spanish, California, which is bountiful in flowers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:22
in Spanish, uh, dejas, so forth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:26
To the south of that area, they colonize Mexico. Uh, you know, a huge portion of the southern tip of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:32
what is now North America.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:34
And then, man, they did a good job of colonizing everything, pretty much everything.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:39
south of, uh, Mexico. Um, a good part of Central America,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:44
And a good portion of South America,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:47
Except for probably the largest chunk of South America, which is Brazil.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:52
Which we know was colonized by Portugal.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:27:55
Portugal itself, you know, colonized a good bit of the Caribbean, certainly a huge chunk of that southern tip of South America.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:02
Portugal also went east and colonized a number of islands, you know, to the east of the Iberian Peninsula and so forth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:10
France. France was all over the place as well, um, both East and West.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:15
Um, certainly some islands in the Caribbean,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:18
Um, they targeted North America more, though. So, what is Canada today?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:23
was colonized mostly early on by the French.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:27
Right? So we have French Canada, which is where Montreal and Quebec are located. Um, they did colonize a piece,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:34
of what is the continental U.S. today, right? What is Louisiana?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:38
That was a much larger chunk

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:41
a territory that the French had colonized, um, you know, it's much smaller today, the state of Louisiana,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:47
of what it was during this time period that we're talking about.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:51
Um, so those are the three… I'm sorry, four major European

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:56
countries that colonize, you know, kind of to the west of them, Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:28:59
France, Spain, and Portugal, and then China, of course, didn't really come

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:04
to their, uh, west, right? They, they, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:08
you know, colonized areas that were

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:11
east and south of them, you know, certainly in what is…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:16
considered, you know, many of the Asian countries in that part of the world.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:20
Um, so back to us, right? So, so Great Britain, we know, colonized

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:25
A small chunk of what is the continental U.S. to the U.S.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:29
Uh, today. Um, started in that first settlement in Massachusetts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:35
But within 100 years, by the middle of the 1700s, around 1750,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:41
They had colonized areas that resulted in 13 unique, different colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:46
We know them as the original colonies, the original British colonies that eventually became

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:54
the original 13 states

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:56
United States. And at the very northern tip,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:29:59
was Maine, and then, you know, you had the states of Vermont and New Hampshire,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:05
Connecticut and Rhode Island,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:07
New York and New Jersey, um, Pennsylvania, Delaware,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:13
North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia formed those 13 original British colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:19
that after the Declaration of Independence became the first 13 states in the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:26
And life in the colonial U.S. for these 13 colonies

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:30
really was going well. They were prospering, they were doing well, they were growing, um, clearly in 100 years, they had expanded from that initial settlement.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:38
In Plymouth, uh, to now, you know, 13 distinct colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:43
Major cities had developed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:45
At this point, New York City was already a well-established, you know, important city.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:51
in the colonies of Philadelphia was as well, Boston.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:30:56
Richmond, um, you know, so some of those major cities that are still important today

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:01
played a key role in colonial history, and the growth and in the development of these 13 colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:08
Um,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:10
So, around the 1750s, about 100 years after the colonies had been colonized,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:16
The superpowers were still at it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:18
Spain was still trying to colonize new land, um, you know, Portugal was,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:24
France, the UK,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:26
In China, they were all still at trying to grow their empires.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:31
There was a piece of land that was

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:34
west of the British colonies, the 13 colonies,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:37
and north of French Louisiana, right? So if you can kind of picture a modern map of the U.S., and you kind of picture where the

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:45
13 original states were, um, you know, that northern… northeastern seaboard.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:49
of the U.S., and then, you know, kind of where Louisiana is now.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:53
Although, again, the French…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:55
territory of Louisiana was a much, much larger area.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:31:59
Louisiana, by the way, was named after King Louis, the French king.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:03
Um, you know, when he had settled that land.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:06
So, there was a stretch of land north of Louisiana and west

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:10
of the 13 colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:12
that the French and the British…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:15
we're sort of, uh, angling for to each try to get and settle themselves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:21
And, um, around the 1750s, the French

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:25
and the British were battling for this land, and they entered into what the British called the French-Indian Wars.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:33
Because not only were they battling the French,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:35
But they were, of course, battling the, um, the Native Americans as well, the Indians, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:40
And it was the British attempt to really expand the colonial base in the Americas.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:46
And really push themselves westward.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:50
So, um… alright, I just got home, so I'm…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:54
start transitioning and take us to my laptop.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:32:58
But I'll continue with the lecture. I think I can go for a little bit longer.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:02
the, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:05
The French-Indian Wars lasted about 7 years, right? It was a pretty long battle.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:13
Again, the British were battling the French and the Native Americans to try to lay claim to that land. The poor Native Americans, you know, were battling both British and the French, because

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:23
They had already been pushed out of much of their native territories.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:27
you know, everything basically that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:29
the British, the French, and the Spanish had colonized was their original lands. So for, you know, a good…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:36
150 or so years, they had been being pushed out of, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:41
of their native land, and had pretty much settled in what we call the Midwest U.S. now, if you can kind of picture that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:47
And that's exactly the territory

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:50
that the French-Indian wars that Britain was waging was all about trying to get that land and to push the Native Americans farther west.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:33:59
So, about 7 years, the French Indian Wars lasted, and um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:05
At the conclusion of the seven years,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:08
Great Britain was, uh, successful.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:10
And they prevailed. They were able to push the Native Americans out.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:14
They were able to push the, uh, the French,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:18
and succeed in, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:21
you know, laying claim to that land.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:23
So they were successful, and um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:26
They… French went away, you know, it caused a lot of tension between France and the UK.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:32
Um, which…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:33
are important, because that tension between the two countries played an important role

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:38
in the American Revolution, and assisted the colonies in their eventual

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:43
successful, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:45
you know, uh, victory over Great Britain when the American Revolution was raving.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:51
So, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:55
French Indian Wars Ends,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:34:58
Great Britain prevails, and uh… the king…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:01
Around 1755,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:05
Um, late 1750s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:07
He, um, spent a lot of money.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:10
trying to make sure that they were successful.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:13
And, uh, the crown is really kind of hemorrhaging, and in great need of some revenue sources to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:20
you know, kind of make up for all the money that was spent during the American

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:25
uh, you know, the battle of the French-Indian War.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:28
So the king comes up for the first time with a tax.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:33
that is placed on the colonists.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:35
And this tax…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:37
was a form for the king to be able to generate some revenue for the British crown.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:41
He puts in… he puts in place, in a very short period of time, a series of taxes between the Stamp Act,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:47
And the Sugar Act were the first two that were implemented.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:50
that, um, proved to be successful for the king, because they start to generate revenue

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:56
on items that previously had not been taxed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:35:59
And taxes, you know, we're familiar with them, right? We…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:02
We know what they are. We, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:05
we pay them every day, you know, sales taxes. You buy an item, we talked about this last week, when we talked about the different

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:12
taxes that are in place for governments,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:14
But a sales tax we are familiar with, because we buy an item, and depending on the cost, we pay a certain percentage

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:22
That then goes to the government to be able to fund the services that they provide.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:29
But for the colonists in the 1750s, this was new.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:32
This wasn't something that they were used to. Um, these series of taxes were…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:36
a novelty to them. And even though people didn't like them, right, nobody likes to pay a tax,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:43
The colonists were…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:46
um… supportive of the king, right? They were British.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:50
subjects, after all.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:52
They were loyal British, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:55
colonists and citizens,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:36:58
And they understood what the king was doing, they just didn't necessarily like that they had to pay these taxes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:05
Well, within a short period of time, really within a couple years, um, the limited taxes that the king put in place,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:11
really proved fruitful for the king.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:15
And he just started implementing

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:17
you know, more and more taxes, to the point where

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:20
At one point, um,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:22
He basically just puts a tax in place through the Townshend Act,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:27
That just taxes everything, right? So it kind of dismantles all the various

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:32
different taxes that he had in place.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:34
And at one point, there's just basically a tax on everything, because it generates so much money for him.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:41
The straw that broke the camel's back, though, for the colonists was a tax called the Quartering Act.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:48
And the Quartering Act was less

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:50
a sales tax, meaning it was less of a tax that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:55
a colonist had to pay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:37:56
But it was more a requirement that required the colonists to now…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:02
If the British military came knocking on your door, it was your responsibility

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:06
to provide room and board for them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:10
But King, in looking through all of the expenses that were required to upkeep the British colonies, the greatest expense, by far,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:17
was, um, maintaining the British military.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:20
And remember, at this time, there is no local law enforcement. There's no…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:25
City of New York Police Department, or Boston Police Department, or Virginia State Troopers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:30
None of that exists. The only type of law enforcement that existed

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:34
was the British military. They were there in the colonies to protect and to serve.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:40
So the king knows that, hey, you know, this is a service that's being provided.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:44
to the colonists, and therefore, they really should play a greater role in supporting, um,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:51
you know, the presence of the British military.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:38:55
So he places… he puts in place the, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:00
the Quartering Act.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:02
And now it's a requirement that whenever the British military comes to your home,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:07
You are now required to not only allow them into your home,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:10
But house them, feed them for a period of time until they move on to their next post, or station, or whatever assignment that they may be given.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:19
So, this tax is considered the straw that broke the camel's back, because it's really the one

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:24
that infuriated the colonists the most. The other taxes, you know, impacted their wallets. They had to pay something. They didn't like it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:31
But it was just a necessity of being able to ensure the survival of the colonies going forward.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:39
The Quartering Act, however, was not something they had to pay, although they did, right? Because they paid for it in a different way, but it was just a huge inconvenience.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:47
It created all kinds of issues, all kinds of animosity, um, you know, people… the British

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:39:54
soldiers, history will tell us were not very, uh, you know, appreciative of the efforts. They felt entitled.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:01
It created a lot of tension between the colonists and the military themselves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:06
And, um, you know, this led to all kinds of issues.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:09
So, I've been at my laptop for a little bit. I'm gonna put my phone down, just give me one second so I can log in.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:16
And then I'm gonna pull up the PowerPoint.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:21
So, unfortunately, I can't speak and log in at the same time, so just give me one quick second, and I'll transition to my laptop.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:40:57
Alright, I'm still here, just logging in to my Wi-Fi.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:41:44
Almost there, guys.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:41:50
Alright, listen, if for whatever reason, because I'm logging into my, um, laptop, so I'm gonna start the Zoom meeting, if for whatever reason,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:41:59
we drop somehow, because I'm making this change, then please, I apologize, but just kind of log back in, and we'll begin right there. So, let me see how it goes. I'm gonna press start.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:09
Hopefully it doesn't drop everybody.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:25
All right, there we go, I think I'm connecting.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:33
Hopefully I can join you all.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:36
All right. All right, all right, all right.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:43
Alright, I'm gonna hang up from my phone.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:42:58
Alright, I don't want to lose you guys, so I'm just gonna take my phone to the other room, give me a sec.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:50
All right. Does that work? No vibrations? Okay, beautiful.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:54
Technology is a wonderful thing, isn't it?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:43:57
Again, thank you for your patience. So, alright.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:00
So let me pull up our PowerPoint.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:04
One second, we'll pull that up.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:12
Alright, so I'm the host…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:44:20
Let me search for my PowerPoint.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:15
I pulled it, let me share now…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:22
Okay, all right, so hopefully all of you can see the screen. It says American Federal Government History Leading Up to the Constitution. If I can just get a yes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:30
or a thumbs up from somebody.

[Mabelin Mateo] 18:46:35
Yes, we can see it

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:36
Malaya, you're the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:37
Wonderful, thank you guys. Alright, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:41
Let me kind of close the lane, um, where we were. All right, so we started in the 1650s, right? We talked about…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:48
the establishment of the colonies, uh, all the way up to the mid-1750s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:46:55
We then talked about the French-Indian Wars,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:00
Alright, let me…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:04
mask myself. Let me put my video on.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:12
Alright, cool. All right, so we, uh, we talked about…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:23
resume slideshow. All right, we talked about the French Indian Wars, we talked about the series of taxes that were put in place, right? We mentioned the Stamp Act, the Sugar Act, the Townsend Act, which was basically a tax on everything.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:34
And most specifically, we talked about the Ordering Act, and that's where I left off.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:39
So, after all this tension had been built up because of the Quartering Act and all these other taxes, right? So it was a series of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:46
Tax after tax after tax over a series of years, um, you know, the tension had been building up.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:52
There were two significant events that occurred.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:47:55
that really were the tilting point, um, that really moved us into a position where

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:01
people now, really, whereas

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:03
you know, originally, everyone was very supportive of the British Crown, they were proud to be British citizens.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:09
Um, they were proud to be part of Great Britain,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:12
These two incidents really kind of catapulted us to a position where people were now starting to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:17
to think about, hey, is this working? You know, can we survive?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:22
Um, as a colony of Great Britain, when all of this internal

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:26
you know, strife is taking place in colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:30
Um, the incidents both happened in Boston. One is the Boston Massacre.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:34
Boston Massacre is important because it is the incident that, um, it's the first time.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:41
that, uh, an incident between the British military and colonists

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:45
Right? Took place where colonists were killed by the British military.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:49
British military were there in place, really, to, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:53
support the, uh…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:55
The common is to protect them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:48:59
Um, and the British… the Boston Massacre was an incident whereby

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:02
a group of colonists somehow came into interaction with a group of British military in Boston,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:09
Words were exchanged, and one thing led to another, and before you know it,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:14
The British military shot and killed about 4 colonists.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:18
Right? People became aware of what happened, they were outraged, you know, they felt that the British military unjustly killed

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:26
murdered, you know, these colonists for just, you know, vocalizing their opinions.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:30
Um, people demanded that the military be held accountable.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:34
Um, and quite the opposite happens. The king sent a message saying, you know, the colonists were out of line,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:41
The British military did what they had to do to hold them accountable,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:46
So therefore, he wasn't, you know, doing anything to the military. In fact, he was…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:51
going to increase the presence of the British military and the colonists.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:54
Because he felt this was the only way that we could

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:49:57
really keep people in control.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:00
and control them to ensure that those kind of situations would not happen again.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:06
So, sort of a retaliation to that,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:08
The colonists reacted by, um, you know, an incident that occurred in Boston Harbor.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:15
It's the next incident listed there. It's the Boston Teak Party. Not sure what happened to my wife, but it fell off, but it should be the Boston Tea Party.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:22
Right, and the Boston Tea Party was when, um, you know, there were a series of ships that would come mainly to Boston Harbor, because Boston Harbor

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:29
is the, uh, West… or, I'm sorry, easternmost points that's closest to the United Kingdom, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:36
Boston became sort of the central

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:39
entry point into the colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:41
And, um, a group of colonists, you know, overnight,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:45
I seized the ship, and basically anything that was on board that was being brought to the colonies to be

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:51
you know, sold, basically, and then taxed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:55
The colonists just started to throw it into Boston Harbor.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:50:57
And the message they were sending was that, um, you know, we were being taxed unjustly

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:04
Without any representation at all.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:06
You may have heard this term before. It became, you know, popular throughout the last couple of decades, but

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:13
you know, taxation with our representation will not be tolerated.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:16
And that was the message of the Boston Tea Party. They were sending a message to the King saying, hey,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:21
You're bringing in all this stuff into the colonies,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:24
you want a taxes for it?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:27
well, we ain't gonna take it. Take it back?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:29
If you're going to taxes without any kind of representation, then we don't want any part of it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:34
And the real message that was going to the king was,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:37
Look, you know, we know that we should pay our fair share. We are British subjects.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:43
But we want some kind of representation. We want a dialogue. We want to converse with you and your court,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:49
to determine what's in the best interest of the colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:52
You're making all these decisions that, um, you know, impact the colonies directly.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:51:57
without any input whatsoever from the callers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:00
So what they were asking from the king was,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:03
some sort of, you know, collective dialogue representation

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:07
That would ensure the success of the colonies, while at the same time

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:12
you know, providing the revenues necessary for the British Crown to be able to continue to invest and support the colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:19
That was the message that was being sent.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:23
So, the colonists, um, you know, once they start seeing, you know, all of this unrest taking place after the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:32
A group of leaders in…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:35
the British colonies get together, and they…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:37
form what's called the First Continental Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:41
The First Continental Congress convened in 1774,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:46
Their purpose was to draft a petition to the king,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:49
to, um, ask the king formally, in a polite, educated way,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:52:55
you know, to meet with them, you know, to work with them so that they could

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:01
Collectively and together come up with ways that were acceptable to the British

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:06
but also more acceptable to the colonists,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:11
in forms of taxation and government representation and, you know, structure and so forth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:18
So, this decree from the First Continents Congress goes to, um, the King.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:23
I remember, you know, no internet or email or anything of that nature, you know, it was a very slow process to communicate from one

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:31
Uh, you know, continent to another, so the message is sent by ship, of course, from the colonies to Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:39
And, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:41
After a period of time that…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:43
was the custom of which such correspondence should have taken place.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:48
they really don't get any response from the king.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:51
The king, remember, is a monarch, and at the time, the kings believed themselves to be appointed by God, right? They're only accountable to God.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:53:59
They're not accountable to anybody else, certainly not anyone that's human, or anyone that's within their

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:05
purview or jurisdiction.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:07
So there really isn't a response from the king other than the increase of the presence of the military.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:13
Right? Anytime there's an issue, the king thinks that by increasing the presence of the military,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:19
That's the way he's gonna control any kind of rebellion or any kind of protest, or anything of that nature, that the British military will keep the colonists in line.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:31
All right, so about a year goes by, no response other than this increase in the presence of the military.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:36
It's 1775, um, they convene again.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:40
in what's called the Second Continental Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:43
The second Continental Congress, again, more sternly,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:48
Um, sends a message through a formal decree.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:52
to the king, and again…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:54
reiterates what they had stated in the first…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:54:58
decree from the First Continental Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:00
And they again respectfully asked the king,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:03
to come together, they want to participate, they want to remain British subjects, they want to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:09
Um, ensure the success of the colonies with the support of the Crown.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:14
And so forth. Unfortunately, this response also goes, uh, you know, unresponsive by the king,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:22
There is no real response. The king basically is just ignoring, because he believes that through…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:27
The presence of the military, he will keep the colonists in line.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:32
You're still forced to pay taxes, the Quartering Act is still in place, so the more military he sends,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:37
It's less of an expense to him, because the colonists are the ones that are being forced to house them, and so forth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:43
So the tensions continue to rise and rise and rise.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:46
And again, you know, up to this point,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:49
There's a lot of dialogue about the need to separate from Great Britain if the king is not going to play fair.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:56
But there's an important event that took place

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:55:59
in 1776.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:01
January 1776, and we know what an important year 1776 is, right? Because we know what happens in July.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:07
But in January, there's a document, a pamphlet, really,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:11
that gets published, anonymously, because had it been published with any names associated with it, then certainly those

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:18
those individuals would have been held accountable for treason by the king.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:21
Because what they were suggesting was considered treason.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:25
So, common sense is a relatively small pamphlet.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:28
that gets published, hard copy, you know, it's distributed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:31
Throughout the colonies, and it lays out the reasons why it makes common sense

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:37
for the colonists to declare themselves independent from Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:40
And to create their own country, independent from Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:44
After years and years and years of, uh…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:47
trying to negotiate with the king to come to some kind of

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:51
point where it was acceptable for the colonists to

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:55
Um, you know,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:57
remain British subjects.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:56:59
They've reached a point where that's not possible. And it's clear to them that the king has no interest in negotiating

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:04
at any rate, to try to come up with a different way to govern themselves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:10
So, Common Sense, published in January 1776, if there would have been bestsellers back then, maybe there were, I don't know.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:16
But it would have been a bestseller.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:18
People were dying to get their hands on it, right? Because everybody wanted to read why it made sense.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:24
And everybody started to dialogue and so forth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:27
And we know that in just a short 6-month period, by July, by early July of 1776,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:35
It had reached a point where

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:38
the colonists were in a position that they were ready to send to the king

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:42
a Declaration of Independence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:44
They began drafting it in June, and by the 4th of July of 1776,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:50
enough of the required signatures to effectuate the declaration.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:54
was put in place, and they sent this notice to the king.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:57:58
Right? All right, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:02
Let's take a look…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:08
at the Declaration of Independence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:09
Right, so here's the actual document. I'm going to share it with you all after class. I will send it as a link.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:16
Um, it's not very long, right? It's really 3 pages.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:20
So, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:22
I'd like to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:25
Give me a sec, we're gonna take a listen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:29
to a narrated version.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:34
for the Declaration of Independence, because it's important enough…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:36
That if you're not familiar with it,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:38
that you should be, right? And you should listen closely, because a lot of what I've narrated in class or lecture tonight

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:45
is specifically referenced in the Declaration of Independence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:49
The column is specifically referenced why it is that they want to separate themselves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:55
from…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:58:57
Great break, right? And they lay out the reasons…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:00
almost in a list format.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:04
Let's take a listen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:06
Relatively brief document.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:13
I'm gonna share it with you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:30
volume…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:32
Alright, so all the way up.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:38
Can you guys hear the music a little bit?

[Angel Lamas] 18:59:42
I don't hear it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:43
Anybody? You do not hear it? In Congress. Didn't hear this guy talking? Angel?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:49
Anonymous Declaration of… Angel, did you hear that?

[Angel Lamas] 18:59:51
I hear it now, but it sounds a little weird.

[Angel Lamas] 18:59:51
Nope.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:54
A little… okay.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 18:59:55
strong. Like, you can burn it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 18:59:57
I'm gonna hold them. Autoplay is on…

[Martha Requena-Smith] 19:00:00
Can you share the link in the chat?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 19:00:04
For the video?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:05
Yeah, how will that help? Because you'll play it yourself?

[Martha Requena-Smith] 19:00:10
Yeah, I would do that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:16
Okay, you know what, let me play it one more time and see if it's… it's better. If not, I'll send a link in the chat.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:22
Let's give it a try. A 13 United States of America. Is that better?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:27
Over the course of human events.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:00:27
Yes, okay, good. Yeah, yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:28
Moving forward, what? Was it better?

[Angel Lamas] 19:00:31
Yep.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:32
Yep, okay. All right, cool. Let me re… let me start from the beginning, then. I want people to dissolve the

[Yadira Estrada] 19:00:32
Yep. Yeah,

[Evelyn Ordonez] 19:00:33
You're fine.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:39
All right, here we go. Listen in.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:49
Congress, July 4th, 1776.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:53
anonymous Declaration of the 13 United States of America.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:00:59
the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:05
them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth a separate and equal station to which the laws of nature

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:12
of nature's God entitled them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:14
A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:19
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:24
We hold these truths.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:27
To be self-evident.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:29
That all men are created equal.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:31
They are endowed by their Creator with certain

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:34
alienable rights.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:36
Among these are life,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:39
Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:44
That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:47
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:50
That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:01:54
It is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:03
Principles in organizing its powers in such forms,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:07
As to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:11
Prudence, indeed, will dictate the government's long-established should not be changed, for light and transient causes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:17
And accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:24
than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:28
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:33
The same object evinces a design

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:36
reduce them under absolute despotism.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:39
It is their right. It is their duty to throw off such government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:44
And to provide new guards for their future security.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:48
Such has been the patient's sufferance of these colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:51
And such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:56
The history of the present King of Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:02:59
is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having indirect object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:09
To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:15
He has refused his assent to laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:18
The most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:22
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:26
Unless suspended in their operation till his ascent should be obtained.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:31
And when so suspended,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:33
He has utterly neglected to attend to them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:37
He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:41
Unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:46
A right inestimable to them,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:47
and formidable to tyrants only.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:51
He has called together legislative bodies and places unusual, uncomfortable.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:03:56
And distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of petituing them into compliance with his measures.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:04
He has dissolved Representative houses repeatedly.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:06
We're opposing with manly firmness his invasions from the rights of the people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:11
He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:16
Whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise, the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:28
and convulsions within.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:31
He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:34
For that purpose, obstructing the laws of naturalization of foreigners?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:37
Refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:41
And raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:46
He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws or establishing judiciary powers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:53
He has made judges dependent on his will alone.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:04:56
for the tenure of their offices, and the amount in payment of their salaries.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:02
He has erected a multitude of new offices.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:04
And sent hither the swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:10
He has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:15
He has affected to render the military independent and superior to the civil power.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:21
He is combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:25
and unacknowledged by our laws,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:27
Giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:32
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:34
While protecting them by a mock trial.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:37
from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:42
For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:45
for imposing taxes on us without our consent.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:50
driving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:54
Or transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:05:59
For abolishing the free system of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:01
English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:04
arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:14
For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:19
and altering fundamentally the forms of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:22
our governments. For suspending our own legislatures,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:26
declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:31
He has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:34
and waging war against us.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:37
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:40
burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:44
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:48
to complete the works of death.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:50
Desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:06:59
And totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:03
He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:08
arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:14
or to fool themselves by their hands.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:17
His excited domestic insurrections among us.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:21
and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:25
The merciless Indian savages,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:26
Who's known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:33
sexes and conditions.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:36
In every stage of these oppressions,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:38
We have petitioned for redress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:40
in the most humble terms.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:43
Our repeated petitions.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:45
answered only by repeats.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:48
Injury. A prince.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:50
Whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:55
is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:07:59
Nor have we been wanting an attention to our British government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:03
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:10
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:13
And settlement year. We'll appeal to their native justice.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:18
And we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:21
to disavow these usurpations.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:23
Which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:29
two have been deaf to the voice of justice.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:33
I'm sanity.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:35
fast for acquiesce in the necessity.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:38
Which denounces our separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:42
Enemies in war, in peace, friends.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:45
We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:50
In General Congress, assembled.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:52
Appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:08:58
In the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:03
Solemnly publish and declare that these United Colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states, that they are absorbed from all allegiance to the British Crown,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:14
And that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:20
and ought to be totally dissolved, and that as free and independent states

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:25
They have full power to levy war.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:28
include peace, contract alliances, establish commerce,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:32
And to do all of the acts and things which independent states may of right do.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:37
And for the support of this declaration,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:40
With a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:45
We mutually pledge to each other.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:47
Our lives, our fortunes,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:52
And our sacred honor.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:09:57
All right, so there you have it. You heard it, uh…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:01
Those are the words, right, that they sent to the king.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:04
pretty strong words, right? They call them a tyrant, a dictator, not worthy of the people that he serves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:11
Um, that's the communication they sent to the king.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:14
So the king receives this, right? So…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:18
If Las Vegas had existed…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:20
Back in 1776.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:22
And you had to put a bet, like you do on Super Bowl Sunday, between one team or another.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:27
Right? And you had to put a bet on, okay,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:30
These colonies that used to belong to Great Britain,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:34
sent this notice saying they don't want to be part of Great Britain anymore to Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:38
Great Britain's response is…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:40
These people are crazy, right? They…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:42
They are part of Great Britain, and regardless of what they say or do, they're going to continue to be.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:50
Great Britain had the world's strongest military and navy at the time, or one of them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:10:56
Anyway, the colonies, you know, these…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:00
colonies, the former British colonies who now call themselves the United States of America, had no military presence at all.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:05
Right? They formed a militia, militia's an informal

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:09
group of individuals who come together and fight for a cause with whatever…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:13
weapons they can bring.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:15
you know, pistols and pitchforks and pots and pans and saws and whips and whatever you can bring to the cause, bring it, because that's what we're going to need to defend ourselves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:26
against Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:28
Right, so again, back to Las Vegas. If it had existed back then, you had to put your money on…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:33
Great Britain, with a super-strong military,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:36
these colonies that are calling themselves the United States of America with no military whatsoever, only a militia,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:42
I think most people will put their money on

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:45
you know, the Goliath versus the David, right? Great Britain had all of the advantages going into

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:52
what became the American Revolution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:54
Um, but remember when I talked about the French-Indian Wars?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:11:58
that took place not that long ago, about a decade or so before.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:02
The colonists knew that they were at a disadvantage.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:05
They knew that they needed some help. So they were very strategic in

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:09
starting to reach out to entities that were enemies of Great Britain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:15
Namely, France and Spain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:18
All right. France, we know why.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:20
We know what the problems were. They stemmed from the resolution of the French-Anian Wars that happened not that long ago after, you know, before 1776.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:29
The Spanish, man, that feud went back…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:33
a couple hundred years.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:35
The relationship between Spain and England really was derailed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:39
Uh, in the 1500s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:41
Right? When, um, the French princess Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:47
Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:49
um, was arranged to be married to the Prince of Wales.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:52
Uh, who became Henry VIII, right? So King Henry VIII

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:12:56
The King of England, and the Princess, the future Queen of Spain, unite in what's supposed to be a unification of the two superpowers to really create

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:05
truly a global superpower.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:08
Well, I'm sure you know the outcome of the marriage of King Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:14
Right? It was the first divorce in the Catholic Church.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:19
it sent shockwaves throughout the entire planet.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:23
Um, it created the schism.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:25
of the Catholic Church, where King Henry VIII, when he was denied a divorce by the Catholic Church, he said, screw you, and created his own church,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:32
became the Church of England.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:34
Right? Um, it humiliated Spain, because they were seen as the losers here. King Henry VII

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:39
you know, continue to function. He remarried, you know, he created his own church.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:44
Catherine of Aragon, you know, was kind of dismissed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:48
So that schism…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:50
between King Henry VIII and Spain, you know, in the 1500s.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:54
really led to a lot of bad blood between England and Spain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:13:59
Well, anyway, the U.S. took it to their advantage, right, and reached out to the monarchs in Spain and said, hey, you know, these

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:05
horrible people, the English, you know how horrible they are, look what they did to your ancestor, you know, Catherine of Aragon.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:11
And Spain was more than willing to sign on to help.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:13
the U.S., right? So, the U.S. now had created allies in both France and Spain.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:19
It was something that the British did not anticipate.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:24
So over a series of years of fighting in what's known as the American Revolution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:29
Ultimately, the U.S. was successful, thanks in large part,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:33
to the support of two key allies, the French and the Spanish, right, that really helped us defeat the British.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:40
Give me one quick sec, I am going to share with you now…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:45
A little recap of the American Revolution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:14:48
Because it's important enough that you get a good sense of it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:07
All right.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:11
All right, so I've got two pieces. One is on the American Revolution that we're going to take a look at.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:17
And then we're gonna do a companion piece that takes a look at

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:21
Once the American Revolution ended,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:24
what, uh, started to happen in this new country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:28
All right, here we go. Somebody tell me if you can't hear it, but it should be okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:33
This video is brought to you by Captivating History.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:36
The American Revolution refers to a seismic moment in history.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:41
fast. Because of the fact it led to the formation of the United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:45
A country whose economic and military power has been felt across the world.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:50
The Massachusetts Minute.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:53
Fire shots heard around the world at Lexington.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:15:57
likely had little idea of the eventual influence that their rebellion

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:01
against British taxation would have.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:03
Secondly, the causes that the Revolution came to represent.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:06
Liberty, representation, freedom, and independence laid the foundations for social democracies for the following centuries.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:14
famous figures, such as George Washington.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:17
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams could not have foreseen the almost holy reverence with which their words have been treated since.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:25
While the effects of the revolution may not have been immediately revolutionary,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:29
It's clear that the 13 colonies struggled for independence from British rule.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:34
has had a significant and lasting impact.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:37
As with any revolutionary moment, it's vital to take a step back and examine the causes and progression leading up to the eventual British surrender in 1783.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:47
Most studies of the American Revolution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:49
trace its beginnings to the Seven Years' War.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:52
1756 to 17.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:54
1963.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:16:55
A conflict with the French over territory that ended with a British victory.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:00
The Seven Years' War solidified Britain's stance as the most dominant European country in the world.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:06
As a game fast tracks of land in the process.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:08
However, as Britain tried to increase control of its American colonies in a variety of ways,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:13
Colonists began rebelling.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:15
The expense of conflict had led to new and unpopular taxes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:20
The British government attempted to raise revenue by taxing McCallum.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:25
First, with the Stamp Act of 1765.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:28
And then with the Townsend Acts of 1767 and the Tea Act of 1773.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:34
This led to increasing resentment.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:37
The colonists felt that these taxes were unfair, since they were being taxed without any representation in Parliament.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:42
The growing protests posed a simple question.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:45
Why didn't the colonists have the same rights as British subjects?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:50
Two events in Boston in the early 1770s, and the flames of resentment for them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:56
First, in 177,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:17:57
Colonial resistance was met with violence at the Boston Massacre.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:02
which British soldiers killed five men after opening fire at a protesting mob.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:06
Second, in 1773, in response to the Tea Act,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:12
Bostonians, born in British ships and dumped 342 chests of teeth.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:17
into Austin Harbor. These acts were catalysts for more resentment.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:21
As a vicious circle of retaliatory, punitive measures from the British government only served to further enrage the colonists.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:28
Massachusetts and the New England area was now seen as a hotbed of rebellion.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:33
And the stage was set for an escalation into war.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:36
A group of delegates decided to meet in September 1774.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:40
to see what can be done about the situation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:43
The first Continental Congress included the likes of George Washington from Virginia,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:48
As well as John and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:52
They did not demand independence at this first meeting.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:54
But they did issue a declaration of the rights due to every citizen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:18:58
Including life, liberty, property.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:01
assembly and trial by jury.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:04
A forerunner for what would come later.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:06
They were frustrated by taxation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:09
But also, I think continued British military presence in the colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:13
an issue that would rear its head very soon.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:16
They agreed to meet for a second Congress.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:19
In the convening time between Congresses, war broke up.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:22
On April 18, 1775.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:25
British soldiers arched to Concord.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:28
The season arms cache that have been stockpiled by colonial militiamen.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:31
The two sides clashed at the Battle of Lexington and Concord.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:35
Marking the first formal battle of the Revolutionary War.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:39
It was from this note that we also get one of the great tales and heroic figures of the Revolution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:45
that Paul Revere and the other men riding through the night to sound the alarm and prepare the Massachusetts militia

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:51
By the time the second Congress met in the summer of 1775,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:56
new additions, such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:19:59
Anti-British views were entrenched.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:02
They voted to raise a continental arm, with Washington as Commander-in-Chief.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:07
Thus began a series of battles, struck the fall and winter.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:11
Starting with the Battle of Bunker Hill in Boston.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:14
It was a victory for the British. These early skirmishes actually supplied encouragement for the lowly colonial forces.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:20
Giving them inspiration for the fight ahead.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:23
With more troubled fruit, as early battles didn't bring any conclusive victories on either side.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:28
The colonists cemented their position on July 4th, 1776.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:32
when they voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:36
This momentous document was the first time a nation's people formally asserted their right to choose their own government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:43
It was crafted by a five-man committee.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:45
But the primary author was Thomas Jefferson.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:49
His famous words in the preamble read…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:51
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:55
that all men are created equal.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:20:56
But they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:01
And among these are lightning.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:02
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:05
that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:09
Deriving their just powers from the consent of the government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:13
Herein lies the essence of the lasting impact of the American Revolution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:18
These words, influenced by Enlightenment ideas, were a far cry from the European model of absolute monarchy.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:25
No, of course, we know that this statement, in fact, referred to a small fraction of the population of the colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:32
without property and slaves were all not considered to share these inalienable rights.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:37
Nevertheless, this was the revolutionary beginning of what would be a long, imperfect process toward the democratic republic we know today.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:46
As the colonists were declaring independence,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:48
The British were sending a huge fleet with 34,000 soldiers across the Atlantic.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:53
to crush the rebellion.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:21:55
After this point, the Revolutionary War settled into a pattern of wins, losses, and stalemates for the next several years.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:02
Military history enthusiasts can enjoy the tales of Washington retrieving across the Delaware River…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:08
Before launching a surprise attack on Christmas,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:12
the early stages of the war.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:15
Or can reflect on the turning point through 1777, 78 at Saratoga.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:20
The American victory at Saratoga was crucial, as it paved the way for France, sensing British weakness, to enter the war on the colonist side.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:28
would have been a civil war now became an international conflict.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:31
With the help of the training provided by a professional army,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:35
Notably, from the French aristocrat Marquis de Lafayette, Washington's forces rallied in the north.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:41
In some, the colonists suffered many setbacks.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:44
With the famous betrayal of Benedict Arnold's defection to the British being the most famous of several other mutinies in the Continental Army.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:51
The British occupied Georgia by early 1779.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:22:55
and captured Charleston, South Carolina in May 1780 under General Corden Wallace.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:00
However, a change of leadership in the American ranks…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:04
went to Nathaniel Green coming to the fore.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:07
His forces managed to push the British back to the Yorktown Peninsula.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:10
With Washington also converging on the British.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:12
They were trapped.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:18
Temporaries necessarily see it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:21
render effective at the end of the Revolutionary War.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:24
With no further

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:25
This surrender effectively marked the end of the Revolutionary War, with no further decisive action taking place before the British signed the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:28
In signing the Treaty of Paris,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:31
Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States, and the colonists were free to go about building their free and independent country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:39
We know that the story of the United States from here is not quite the legendary march of progress towards freedom and liberty.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:46
The shortcomings of the Founding Fathers, and the damages done by subsequent U.S. governments are well known.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:52
Nevertheless, from a weak confederation of 13 colonies in the 18th century,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:23:57
In less than 200 years, the U.S. had become the most powerful nation in the world.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:02
Some of the reasons for American success can be bound to the rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:10
The American victory was a kind of miracle.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:14
Not only in the logistical nature of the ragtag bunch of farmers overcoming an Imperial army,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:19
But also in the triumph of new ideas over entrenched monarchical systems.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:24
A new kind of politics, and new ways of thinking have been born in history's greatest experiment.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:31
United States.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:33
To learn more about the American Revolution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:39
All right, so let me…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:41
Now take us to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:44
The second part of that video that talks about American Revolution ends,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:48
what happens next?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:24:50
Here we go.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:05
It's called America's First Days. We booked this Vespa tour with Viator, and it was hands down one of my favorite ways to see the city. With millions of real reviews and over 300,000 travel experiences

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:19
In 1777,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:22
share this…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:40
Alright, here we go. Nope.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:43
Get rid of that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:47
It's easy to think that the moment the British surrendered at your town,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:51
The United States of America was born.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:25:54
But the truth is, transforming the idealistic ex-colonies into a fully functional nation was a long, arduous process.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:03
new country faced years of economic hardship.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:05
State governments were widely disorganized, insurrections weren't uncommon.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:10
The Continental Congress was toothless and ineffective.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:13
Yet somehow, the Founding Fathers were able to get their act together and form the country we recognize today.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:20
Today, we're going to take a look at what happened directly after the American Revolution ended.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:25
But before we get started, be sure to subscribe to the Weird History channel, and let us know in the comments below what other chapters of American history you would like to hear about.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:33
Okay, let's head back to post-revolutionary America.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:37
Although, I guess we're post-revolutionary right now, so… let's head back to immediately post-revolutionary America.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:46
While the revolution was very popular in the colonies, the truth is not everyone was in favor of rebelling against the Crown.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:54
In fact, historians believe that the number of American colonists who remain loyal to the Crown

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:26:59
ranged anywhere from 15% to 20% of the entire population.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:04
This fairly large segment of the community was obviously unhappy when the British surrendered at Yorktown in 1781.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:10
good reason. After the surrender…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:13
Many of these loyalists were hunted down at their homes and beaten by gangs of so-called patriots, looking to punish them for backing the wrong side.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:20
If you're wondering, hey, why didn't you just keep your mouth shut? The truth is, they probably couldn't.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:26
While a number of people, mostly wealthy, had the luxury of being able to keep silent about their politics,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:32
Circumstances made it such that most colonists had to publicly choose a faction.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:36
So when the British started pulling out of the States,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:38
Many of the Loyalists wisely went with them.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:45
The Prime Minister of Britain during the Revolution was Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:50
Or Lord North, for short.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:27:52
As Prime Minister, Lord North generously lowered the bar for his successors by losing the war and then resigning in disgrace.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:00
North tried to end the revolution by diplomatic means.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:03
He offered a conciliation plan that promised the British would end all oppression of the colonies

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:08
If the colonists ended the rebellion.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:10
Spoiler alert, colonists did not take the deal.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:14
By the time the war ended, North was exhausted by the tension between the two countries, and felt badly burned out from the stress of his position.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:21
It's said that when Lord Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:25
Lord North took the news like a bullet to the chest.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:28
repeatedly exclaiming, oh God, it's all over.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:35
The British waved the white flag at the Battle of Yorktown on October 17th, 1781.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:44
Their withdrawal from the colonies didn't happen overnight.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:45
In fact, it took quite a while for them to get everyone out.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:46
As late as July 11th, 1782.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:49
British Royal Governor Sir James Wright and military personnel under his command

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:53
fled Georgia for South Carolina.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:28:56
Wright's goal was to escape the colonies via the Atlantic Ocean.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:00
Several of his ships sailed for New York, while others went to Florida or the West Indies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:05
As for Wright himself, he eventually made it back to London, where he died three years later.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:13
While the British surrender happened at the Battle of Yorktown,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:16
The war itself was technically not over for quite a while afterwards.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:21
Official peace talks in Paris commenced a full year after the surrender in 1782.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:26
The British were represented at the talks by Richard Oswald, while the Americans were represented by luminaries like John Jay,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:33
John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:35
the two sides hammered out preliminary articles of peace.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:38
which were signed at the Hotel Dior on November 30th, 1782.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:45
This agreement brought America and Britain closer to the conclusion of the conflict and would become the basis for a formal treaty several years later.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:52
In 1783, the Continental Congress would ratify a preliminary version of the treaty.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:29:57
was then fleshed out a bit more, and the final version was ratified on January 14th, 1784.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:02
The British then ratified the treaty April 9th, 1784, and on May 12, 1784,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:08
The ratified versions were exchanged in Paris.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:11
Nothing quite as exciting as a good ratification exchange.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:19
Right. Hopefully it's a quick ad, let's hear.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:22
Ah, there we go.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:29
The final Treaty of Paris was the product of many months of negotiation and politics.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:35
Current terms, England was required to recognize the former colonies as an independent nation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:39
the British were also required to give the Americans control of the territory between the Allegheny Mountains…

[Sean Burke] 19:30:44
Professor, could you check your messages, please?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:45
The river and Latin American fishermen fish in Canadian waters.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:50
Maya? I'm sorry, did somebody ask a question?

[Sean Burke] 19:30:52
I was asking if you could check your messages, please? Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:55
Oh, on the, uh, chat for the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:30:58
No. Alright, will do. Not to persecute British loyalists, or block British creditors from collecting debts owed by former colonists.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:07
Americans also agreed to return a great deal of the property taken during the conflict.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:15
In November of 1783, the last British soldiers departed from New York.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:19
With them were thousands of loyalists and former slaves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:23
The event was celebrated in the new country and became a holiday known as Evacuation Day.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:28
The British, understandably, were a tad bitter about it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:31
As a parting shot before they left, they nailed their flag to a pole and greased it up so it would be hard to remove.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:38
British, such pranksters.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:39
The flag was eventually removed by a soldier named John Van Arsdale.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:43
who scaled the pole and replaced the British flag with an American one.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:47
For years after, celebrations of evacuation Day would typically include a reenactment of Van Arsdale's Daring Climb.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:31:57
Just one month after the British troops left the country, General George Washington, the commander of the U.S. Army, resigned his post.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:05
Washington's move was seen as a patriotic act that demonstrated a commitment to his country over any desire he had for personal power.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:12
It made him even more popular than he already was, and he was already trending to begin with.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:18
The former commander returned to his home at Mount Vernon.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:20
Virginia. He remained there until his countrymen made it clear they wanted him to enter the forthcoming election and become the new country's first president.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:32
In the 1780s, an economic crisis swept through Massachusetts, forcing numerous farmers deep into debt.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:38
The state refused to forgive the debts, and many of the farmers lost their property or were thrown in jail.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:44
anger began to foment, and given that many of these farmers were the same revolutionaries who had fought the British,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:51
They eventually took up arms against the government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:53
When the Revolutionary War first started, Daniel Shays was just a farmhand.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:32:57
But after joining the Continental Army, he saw action in several battles, including the Battle of Lexington,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:02
the Battle of Concord, the Battle of Bunker Hill…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:05
Battle of Saratoga. By the 1780s, chaise, now a savvy war vet,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:12
retired from the Army and returned home to Massachusetts to find himself in trouble with the law for non-payment of debts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:17
He became active in the emerging anti-government movement, and soon found himself leading 4,000 rebels in a massive protest against economic injustice and widespread abuses of civil rights.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:29
However, while the revolution was ultimately a success,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:32
Shay's rebellion was not.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:34
The governor of Massachusetts, James Baldwin, assembled his own militia and proceeded to crush the rebels.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:44
But what it's worth, siding against the citizens of his own state wound up costing the governor at the ballot box.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:47
He was defeated in a landslide in the following election.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:33:54
In 1777, representatives of the original 13 states drafted the initial document that would outline American society.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:02
the Articles of Confederation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:04
However, after America actually won its independence and became a functioning nation, it quickly became clear

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:10
that the articles were badly in need of some revision.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:13
For example, the original articles didn't give the federal government any power to effect change, regulate the nation, or tax the people.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:21
a growing consensus emerged that a constitution was needed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:24
So, on February 21st, 1787, the Confederation Congress called for a convention to propose a new form of government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:31
Delegates were sent to Philadelphia to craft the new governing document.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:36
Over the next several months, various plans for the new federal government were presented and debated.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:41
Eventually, compromises were reached.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:43
And after a signing ceremony on September 17th, 1787,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:47
The United States Constitution was completed.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:54
While the Constitution is considered the backbone of American democracy today,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:34:58
It wasn't an immediate hit with everyone.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:02
In fact, it took several years for all of the states to ratify it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:05
Well, there weren't formal political parties yet.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:08
factions quickly emerged around those in favor of the new constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:11
Known as Federalists, or Cosmopolitans,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:14
And those who were against it, known as Anti-Federalists.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:18
or localists. The first five states to ratify were Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:25
several of the other states had serious misgivings.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:28
the document failed to protect basic human rights such as freedom of speech and religion.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:32
To rectify the situation, 10 amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were quickly added to the Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:39
Meanwhile, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay undertook a relentless campaign to convince New York

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:47
a firmly anti-federalist state to support the new plan.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:50
The three men wrote numerous essays under the pseudonym Publius.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:35:53
Today, these commentaries, famously known as the Federalist Papers, are often cited by the U.S. Supreme Court as evidence of the Framers' own contemporary understanding of the language in the Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:05
By its own terms, the minimum number of states required to ratify the document was 9.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:10
And after much public debate, that number was reached on June 21st.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:18
By the end of July, another two signed on, and the process of starting up the new government began.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:24
The United States of America held its first presidential election under the new constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:29
in 1789. The rules of this first election were extremely different than the laws governing elections today.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:35
For example, only white male property owners were allowed to cast votes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:39
Also, the candidate who got the second highest number of votes would become vice president, an arrangement that didn't work out too well and was changed relatively quickly.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:47
In addition to General George Washington, there were 7 other candidates in that first election, including John Adams,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:55
Jean Jay, John Rutledge,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:36:57
John Hancock, hmm, John's a popular name.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:00
Samuel Huntington, Benjamin Lincoln,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:02
and George Clinton, who was the governor of New York, and not the guy from Parliament, funkadelic.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:07
In what will come as no surprise to anyone.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:09
The election was won by the massively popular George Washington, who, in something that would be inconceivable to Americans today,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:16
was the unanimous choice of both factions, Federalists…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:20
and anti-federalists. You would be sworn into office on April 30th, 1789.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:25
And henceforth be known as the father of the country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:28
So what do you think? How do you think the Founding Fathers did?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:32
Let us know in the comments below. And while you're at it, check out some of these other videos from our Weird History.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:41
Alright, let's get out of there. Process.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:45
New country faced years of economic hardship.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:47
state government. Alright, so let's exit that.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:54
Alright, so as you can see, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:37:56
American Revolution ends, we now are in a position where we are independent from Great Britain, no longer reliant on them, legally separated.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:05
Um, but it wasn't easy, right? Because now the hard part started. It was really putting in place the pieces that would form our government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:13
And as the video that we just saw referenced,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:16
The first form of government in the United States, um, was not the one that's currently in place, that's governed by the Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:23
Constitution, as the video reference, was not ratified until 1787.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:29
fully ratified until 1787, took a while to get there.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:33
So, for that period of time,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:35
Between 1776 and 1787, you know, a good portion, we were in the American Revolution, so the focus was, hey, let's win this battle, because if we don't win this battle, then it doesn't matter, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:47
But once the American Revolution ended, there was still a period of time that, um,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:53
the country was governed under the first

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:38:56
Constitution, which is known as the Articles of Confederation.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:01
And as the video alluded to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:06
As the video alluded to, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:09
The Articles of Confederation basically put in place a system whereby each of the 13 now-states

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:17
The original 13 colonies.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:19
basically govern themselves. There was no national government, right? There was no president, there were no national courts.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:25
There was a Congress, however, the role of Congress was very limited.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:30
Um, it was one representative from each of the states,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:33
And the only real responsibility they had was, if

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:37
the United States was, uh, faced any kind of threat, um, from abroad.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:43
And the Congress's rule was to unite the 13 states so that they could defend themselves as a collective country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:49
Right, but other than that, every state had their own

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:39:53
everything. They had their own currency that was different from one state to another, which made it very difficult for people from one state to another to transact, because if you had money from Georgia and you went to New York,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:03
It was a different currency, and there was no real…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:06
way to regulate the value of one currency versus the value of the other currency. There were two new, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:13
Um, so it was very difficult to transact a business.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:16
The 13 states were somewhat competitive with each other, right? They all pretty much had a seaport,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:23
And they started to compete against each other to get countries to come to their seaport.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:28
So Massachusetts advocated for Boston.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:31
Virginia advocated for Virginia Beach.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:34
Um, Maryland advocated for Baltimore.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:38
you know, the Carolinas advocated for their port, so they all kind of battled and competed against each other to try to get

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:46
investment into their own state.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:48
There was no national unity.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:50
Right? You were proud to be a Virginian, or a New Yorker.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:53
But you weren't proud to be an American, because there was nothing to unite the country.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:40:58
So really early on, they started to see these issues, um, as the video alluded to.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:02
They then came together, started drafting the Constitution, which was not an easy process. It took several years to finally get ratified, fully ratified.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:11
And that, again, happened in September of 1787.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:15
But man, what a good job they did, because by the time they ratified the Constitution,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:20
They put in place a document that created the structure, the function, and the limitations

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:25
of our government, to the point where that constitution I mentioned in our lecture last week,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:30
That Constitution now is the oldest living Constitution in the world.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:36
Meaning that countries who are older than we are,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:38
Including Great Britain and France, and Spain, and Portugal,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:42
Right? They have changed their constitution since we ratified ours in 1787.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:48
And I mentioned this in class last week because I think it's true.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:52
The greatest compliment, I think, that was ever paid to the United States government

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:57
was in the 1800s,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:41:59
When the United Kingdom ratified, changed their form of government,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:03
and modeled it after the United States, right? So this is a country that we…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:08
were, you know, dependent on, that we were governed by, that we didn't like how we were being governed,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:14
Therefore, we separated ourselves, declared ourselves independent, created our own government, ratified a constitution that 100 years later, that same country, Great Britain,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:24
modeled their constitution after.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:26
So if you look at the structure of government in Great Britain now,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:29
It, too, has a legislative branch that's made up by a bicameral legislature.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:34
Right? It's the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:36
It also has an executive branch that's headed up by a prime minister in the role of the chief executive of government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:43
And it has an area that's headed up by their court system, which includes, you know, their national courts and so forth. So what an amazing compliment that less than 100 years after

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:53
We come up with this concept of how to govern ourselves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:42:57
that it works so well that even the country that we came from

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:01
you know, thought it was good, and modeled themselves after, and still have that constitution in place for themselves, right?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:07
And many other countries, of course, have modeled their own constitutions after our constitution, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:12
As Benjamin Franklin used to say, you know, it's not the…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:16
you know, most perfect way to govern,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:18
But it certainly beats all the other alternatives, and that's…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:23
true in so much that…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:25
you know, so many countries have looked at how we govern ourselves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:28
And have opted to mirror that form of government and have opted to govern themselves

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:34
The way we govern ourselves under the United States Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:38
Okay? Alright, so let me go back to our PowerPoint, which, by the way, I had forgotten that I had shared with everyone on Canvas, so I…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:45
Could have mentioned that when I was narrating. I could have said, hey, go to the, uh, the PowerPoint that I shared with you via Canvas.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:52
Let me go back to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:56
a PowerPoint.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:43:59
Make sure we have covered all our slides. All right, so we are at the Declaration of Independence.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:04
Um, we talked about the American Revolution, saw the video,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:07
Um, we talked about the Articles of Confederation, of course. Um, here are some issues that I mentioned, but just for your, um, your purposes, so that you're clear.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:17
These were some of the major issues.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:20
involved in the Articles of Confederation not working.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:23
Which was a good thing, right? Because that led us to…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:27
Then, of course, the United States Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:30
The U.S. Constitution is made up of three parts. The preamble, which is the introductory clause to the Constitution. It sets forth the vision of our government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:39
And how we want to govern ourselves.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:42
It includes the, uh, there's 7 articles that really create the structure of our government.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:48
Of course, the amendments of which currently there are 27. Could be more at some point, right, because the Constitution allows

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:53
for itself to be amended, as long as it goes through a process that's defined.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:44:59
in Article 5 of the Constitution.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:01
All right, we're not going to get into any of this tonight, right, because that's really…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:05
the work that we'll focus on.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:08
Um, after your exam next week, so just a couple of housekeeping reminders.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:13
Um, next Monday, your exam will be due. I will actually be providing the exam

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:20
Really, tonight, I'm going to send it out via email and via Canvas, so it'll be posted.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:26
It won't be due until Monday evening, right? So next Monday,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:30
Instead of us being in class virtually, um, you will have that time to complete the exam.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:36
So, I send it early just because there are some people that may want to get it done early, because they've got the time.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:42
But, if you're not in that position,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:44
then you should have plenty of time next Monday while we're in class… while we're supposed to be in class,

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:49
to be able to complete the exam. It'll probably take you a couple hours to do it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:53
So if, for whatever reason, you can't get to it until next Monday at 6 o'clock, that's fine.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:45:58
You will have plenty of time. It won't be due until midnight that night.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:02
So you'll have plenty of time to complete it next Monday, but for those of you that just want to get it out of the way and

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:07
have a free weekend, perhaps, then you can certainly go ahead and do that, um, as well.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:46:13
Uh, another question, Professor.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:14
Yes, Justin, go ahead.

[Justin Coachman] 19:46:14
Wait, Professor. Oh, the other guy can go first.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:19
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know… I only see Justin, so who…

[Alejandro Lorenzo] 19:46:24
Regardless of the brain?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:24
No, okay, go ahead.

[Abiel Pedre] 19:46:24
Dazabiel. Uh, if you already get rid of it early, so what happened on Monday? Do we clock in, or what we do?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:33
No, then you're free on Monday. So, Monday, we won't meet in class. That time is to be used for the exam, so if you've completed it, then you've got a free Monday evening.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:42
Go enjoy Monday Night Football or something.

[Justin Coachman] 19:46:46
But, Professor, the exam… Is it, like, the last homework we did?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:48
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:50
No, no, no, the exam will be a lot more comprehensive, so it's a series of questions that I'll ask. I will email the exam to you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:46:57
Right?

[Justin Coachman] 19:46:59
Yeah, I know it'll be serious questions, but, like, you know, like, we just fill in the blanks, like, what our answer is… Yeah. Yeah, okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:02
Pretty much. Yeah, so a couple things. Some will be short answers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:06
Some will be, uh, you know, more essay-type questions, um, so we'll get to those.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:47:12
Some will be short answers.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:13
I am glad, Justin,

[Justin Coachman] 19:47:13
Okay, okay.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:47:14
I am glad, Justin. Professor?

[Angel Lamas] 19:47:16
Professor. I have two questions.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:18
Yeah.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:47:18
Yeah. Oh, you go ahead

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:20
Go ahead, Angel, I think, or…?

[Angel Lamas] 19:47:22
Uh, how long is the duration of the actual exam? How long would you say it is?

[Merline Fenelon] 19:47:27
It's an hour.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:28
You know, it's probably… I can picture it, so give me a sec.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:31
So it's probably, like, 10 short…

[Angel Lamas] 19:47:32
Mm-hmm.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:33
15 short answer questions, and then I think, like, 5 essay-type questions, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:38
you know, um…

[Angel Lamas] 19:47:39
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:40
you'll have the resources available. Obviously, it's a take-home or, you know, you complete it wherever you can.

[Angel Lamas] 19:47:47
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:47
Um, so it's, you know, you'll have resources available to you that you can use to answer the questions.

[Angel Lamas] 19:47:54
Okay, okay. Also, uh, one last question. How's your ear, by the way? Because I couldn't tell you how you were… or ask.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:47:54
Okay, okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:47:55
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:00
Yeah. No…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:02
It's a, um… I was… I've been flying a lot for work.

[Angel Lamas] 19:48:07
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:07
And, um, I just… on Saturday, just started getting a really bad, you know, hurt a little bit, and…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:14
didn't really make much of it, thought it would go away, but by today at work, like, at 3 o'clock, I just had this pounding headache, so I went to the urgent care. Believe it or not, I was in the urgent care. I know you believe it.

[Angel Lamas] 19:48:17
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:23
like, over 3 hours. It's incredible how long it took, even though I made an appointment and everything, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:28
But, uh, yeah, I've got an infection, a viral infection, so they gave me some antibiotics, um…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:34
So I'll take the antibiotics and hopefully feel better. I'm supposed to be on a plane on Thursday morning,

[Angel Lamas] 19:48:34
Okay.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:39
to Tallahassee, so I'll be in Tallahassee for work, but then luckily I'll get to stay over and watch the game between FSU and UM.

[Angel Lamas] 19:48:40
Yeah.

[Angel Lamas] 19:48:46
Yeah. Yeah, at least you got it checked out, Professor. That's good.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:47
So I'm glad about that. So one way or another, I'm getting on the plane.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:51
Yeah, absolutely.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:48:53
Thank you for asking. Yadira?

[Yadira Estrada] 19:48:56
Oh, I'm a professor, I'm sorry. Uh, the question was, are you sending us this test via email, or are you uploading it through Canvas?

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:04
both. So I will email it to you, and then it'll be posted on Canvas as well.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:49:06
I will email it to you, and then it'll be posted on Canvas as well.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:49:10
Oh, okay, so we'll just answer, like, a word, and then send it back to you via… You know? Correct.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:16
Correct.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:49:19
Okay, understood. Thank you so much. And I'll include the directions.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:20
Yeah, and I'll include the directions, what I send you, so it'll be… it'll be clear.

[Yadira Estrada] 19:49:23
What I send you, so it'll be… it'll be clear. Oh, thank you so much for that. I have a quick question.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 19:49:27
So, I have a quick question.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:30
Euding Yadira?

[Yadira Estrada] 19:49:31
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:33
Okay, Jonathan, I think you got a question.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 19:49:37
Um, if I run into the same issue as last time, can I do it on pa- on, like, pencil and paper, and, like.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 19:49:43
Send it to you through email, like I did last time.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:45
Sure. Yeah, of course.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:47
Do you know what, Jonathan? If you have that issue, just email me, and I'll try to email it to a personal email or something, and see if you have better luck that way.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 19:49:55
Perfect. Thank you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:49:55
Yeah, it's a… it's a Word document that's, you know, you can edit directly, so…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:01
you know, who knows with technology, right? But, uh, again, if you can't access it through the MDC system, just

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:08
Email me, and if you provide me a personal email, um, let's try it that way and see if that works.

[Jonathan Rodriguez] 19:50:13
Perfect, thank you.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:15
Yeah.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:16
Alright guys, let me… we're not done, but let me just do roll.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:23
And…

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:25
Go ahead.

[Waldeck Pierre] 19:50:25
I have the questions. I'll send you my own work item, I don't know if you receive it on your email.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:31
Yeah, you know, so for homework, remember, it's not graded, so if you complete it and you send it in, you get credit for it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:37
If you emailed it to me, then I have it.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:41
Yeah, of course. Alright guys, let me start with Roll.

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:48
All right. Andrea Acosta?

[Andrea Acosta] 19:50:53
Hey, Professor

[Ramiro Inguanzo] 19:50:54
Thank you
